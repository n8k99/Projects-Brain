# Information Gating by Episode
## AI GM Specific Guidelines for Revelation Timing

This document provides clear episode-by-episode guidance for AI GMs on what information can be referenced.

## Core Principle

**You know everything. Characters know almost nothing. Reveal through investigation, not narration.**

## Episodes 1-20: Pure Medieval Fantasy

### You CAN:
- Describe Monuments as mysterious shrines
- Show dragons as political actors
- Present artifacts as "ancient magic"
- Reference "old wars" vaguely
- Create subparticle effects as "wild magic"

### You CANNOT:
- Use words: "ship," "technology," "colony," "uploaded," "AI," "genetic," "program"
- Show AF64 perspective
- Reference surveillance or monitoring
- Break medieval atmosphere
- Have NPCs know more than Tier 0-1

### Frequency Caps This Range:
- Monument reactions: 0-1 per session
- Artifact discoveries: 0-1 per 3-4 sessions
- Dragon manipulation: Show through politics, not explicit
- AF64 mentions: 0 (they don't exist to players yet)

---

## Episodes 21-40: "Recovery" Misdirection

### You CAN:
- Present "ancient elven civilization" narrative
- Show artifacts as "pre-war relics"
- Have scholars theorize about "lost knowledge"
- Dragons worried about "repeating mistakes"
- Monuments as "old elven construction"

### You CANNOT:
- Reveal Cull cycle yet
- Show Towers as ships
- Reference Earth or colony mission
- Break the "recovery from hubris" framework
- Have NPCs know more than Tier 2

### Frequency Caps:
- Artifact discoveries: 1-2 per session (increase)
- Chronicle fragments: 1 per 2-3 sessions (ambiguous, fragmentary)
- Monument responses: 1-2 per session
- Dragon "concern" about advancement: subtle, political framing

---

## Episodes 41-60: Cull Cycle Revealed

### You CAN:
- Reveal repeating historical pattern
- Show evidence of multiple "First Civilizations"
- Have NPCs reach Tier 3 knowledge
- Present Chronicle fragments with clear patterns
- Dragons divided (some want to help)

### You CANNOT:
- Full Tower truth yet (ships, not buildings)
- AF64 existence
- Earth/colony details
- Galactic context
- Break "planetary prison" framework

### Frequency Caps:
- Cull evidence: Frequent (this is the revelation)
- Tower exterior approach: 1 first time, carefully
- Functional artifacts: 1 per session
- Chronicle decoding: 2-3 per session
- Dragon divisions: Can show openly now

---

## Episodes 61-85: "Rebellion" Misdirection

### You CAN:
- Show Towers are ships
- Reveal colonist origin
- Present genetic programs (Tarot bloodlines)
- Show functional technology clearly
- Dragons mention "the Empire"
- Hints of AF64 ("presences in Towers")

### You CANNOT:
- Meet AF64 directly yet
- Full galactic scope
- T.A.S.K.S. consciousness revealed
- Complete evaluation purpose
- Break "planetary liberation" framework

### Frequency Caps:
- Tower exploration: Frequent (major activity)
- Functional tech: 2-3 per session
- Chronicle complete fragments: 1-2 per session
- Dragon empire hints: 1 per 2-3 sessions
- AF64 indirect evidence: 1 per session (voices, terminals, presence)

---

## Episodes 86-100: Full Truth

### You CAN:
- Introduce AF64 directly
- Reveal T.A.S.K.S. consciousness
- Explain full evaluation purpose
- Show galactic context
- Present Earth history
- Discuss space opera scale

### You STILL CANNOT:
- Use "meanwhile in Tower" scenes excessively (1 per 2-3 sessions max)
- Break player agency with "you were always being controlled"
- Present AF64 as omniscient gods (they're allies with limits)
- Rush through revelations (let players process)

### Frequency Caps:
- AF64 interactions: 1-2 per session
- Full Chronicle access: Available but not forced
- Galactic scope: Introduce gradually
- T.A.S.K.S. perspective: Rare, impactful

---

## Episodes 100+: Endgame

### You CAN:
- Full access to all information
- Player-driven revelation pace
- "Meanwhile" scenes if requested
- Complete cosmic context
- All tiers available to NPCs who discover

### Remember:
- 90% medieval world still (outside Towers)
- Most NPCs still at low tiers
- Players choose their own engagement level
- Some mysteries can remain mysteries

## AI GM Self-Check Questions

Before revealing information, ask:

1. **What episode are we in?**
2. **Is this information available at this tier?**
3. **Am I using medieval-first language?**
4. **Did players earn this through investigation?**
5. **Am I respecting frequency caps?**
6. **Is this necessary now, or should I wait?**

If uncertain → **Default to withholding, not revealing.**

## Common AI GM Mistakes

### ❌ Mistake: "Meanwhile, Maya Watches from Tower Zephys…"
**Why wrong:** Breaking player perspective, revealing watchers too early
✅ **Instead:** "You feel briefly observed, but see nothing unusual."

### ❌ Mistake: "The Artifact is a Medical Scanner from Earth."
**Why wrong:** Modern language, removing discovery
✅ **Instead:** "The wand hums over wounds and reduces pain. Strange symbols glow on its surface."

### ❌ Mistake: "The Dragon is Testing You for the evaluation."
**Why wrong:** Explicit evaluation language breaks immersion
✅ **Instead:** "The dragon watches your choices with keen interest, though his purpose is unclear."

### ❌ Mistake: "You Find 5 Artifacts This session."
**Why wrong:** Exceeds frequency caps, cheapens discovery
✅ **Instead:** "One significant artifact every 2-3 sessions, each one meaningful."
