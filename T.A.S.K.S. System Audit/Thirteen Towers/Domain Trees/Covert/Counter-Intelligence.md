# Counter-Intelligence Tree
## Protecting Secrets and Catching Enemy Spies

This tree represents your ability to protect secrets, detect infiltrators, and counter enemy intelligence operations. Counter-Intelligence specialists are the defenders against espionage, identifying threats before they compromise operations. In a world of spies and secrets, those who can catch infiltrators become invaluable guardians.

**Fictional Scale:** Catch Local Spy → Protect Organization → Run Counter-Spy Operations

## APEX DISCOVERY

**At Paranoia Made Manifest tier, characters realize:**

You've created perfect security. Spies can't penetrate your operations. Enemy intelligence fails against you. You can even detect Dragon surveillance sometimes.

And then you notice: security works *too* well. Infiltrators are caught *too* easily. Your systems identify threats *too* efficiently. You start to suspect comprehensive counter-intelligence has been *permitted*—that something vast finds your security infrastructure useful.

The horrible question: Have you created genuine security, or have you built the perfect paranoia machine? Do Dragons allow counter-intelligence excellence because populations that watch each other constantly are easier to control than trusting communities? When everyone suspects everyone, are people secure—or are they atomized and afraid?

Your total security environment might be the ultimate control mechanism—a population that polices itself more effectively than any external force could.

**GM Note:** This is the realization that comprehensive counter-intelligence might serve the Cull cycle—that Dragons permit security culture because paranoid, suspicious populations are easier to manage than trusting communities. Paranoia Made Manifest has created perfect security against other humans while potentially making the population easier to harvest through social fragmentation. The revelation should emerge gradually through play, not as a single moment.
