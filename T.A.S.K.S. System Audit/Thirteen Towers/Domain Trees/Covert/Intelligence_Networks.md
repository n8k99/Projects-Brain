# Intelligence Networks Tree
## Building and Managing Spy Networks

This tree represents your ability to build, maintain, and leverage networks of informants, spies, and intelligence operatives across regions and realms.

---

## Street Ears (Novice Tier)

**Advancement Trigger:** Cultivate at least 3 reliable street-level informants in one city

**Prerequisites:** None

### Features:

#### Urban Intelligence Network
**Mechanical Effect:** Once per session in a city where you've spent at least one day, you can declare that one of your street contacts witnessed something relevant to your current investigation. The GM tells you what they saw and one complication (the witness is scared, the information is incomplete, someone else knows they talked, etc.).

**Act Interpretations:**
- Act 2: "Local historians and archivists share recovered knowledge"
- Act 4: "Street-level resistance sympathizers report occupation movements"  
- Act 5: "Civilian intelligence assets report fleet activity"

#### Safe House Protocol
**Mechanical Effect:** You can retroactively establish that you have a safe house in any city you've visited. Spend 1 Stress to activate this safe house immediately. Each safe house has basic supplies, a secure entrance, and can hide up to 3 people for up to 3 days before risk of discovery increases.

**Act Interpretations:**
- Act 2: "Hidden libraries and secure research spaces"
- Act 4: "Resistance safe houses and weapons caches"
- Act 5: "Fleet intelligence dead-drop locations"

#### Street Reputation
**Mechanical Effect:** Passive +1 Edge when gathering intelligence in cities where you have established contacts (minimum 3 informants).

---

## Trusted Informant (Journeyman Tier)

**Advancement Trigger:** Successfully protect an informant from exposure, earning their deep loyalty

**Prerequisites:** At least one feature from Street Ears

### Features:

#### Loyalty Protocol
**Mechanical Effect:** Your key informants have a Loyalty track (3 boxes per informant, maximum 5 informants). When you protect an informant from harm or exposure, mark 1 Loyalty. You can spend Loyalty boxes for:
- **1 Loyalty:** Informant reveals dangerous or personally compromising information
- **2 Loyalty:** Informant takes a major risk on your behalf (infiltrates a location, steals something, lies to authorities)
- **3 Loyalty:** Informant sacrifices something significant (their position, reputation, or safety)

Loyalty resets to 0 if you fail to protect an informant when you had the opportunity.

**Act Interpretations:**
- Act 2: "Trusted scholars risk reputation sharing forbidden knowledge"
- Act 4: "Resistance members risk capture for the cause"
- Act 5: "Intelligence assets risk exposure to deliver critical intel"

**Prerequisite for:** Network Resilience (Cell Organizer)

#### Dead Drop Mastery
**Mechanical Effect:** You can establish undetectable dead drops and secure communication channels. Counter-intelligence requires Expert-tier capabilities and an Action to detect your dead drops. You can maintain simultaneous secure communications with up to 5 separate contacts without them knowing about each other.

**Act Interpretations:**
- Act 2: "Encoded scholarly correspondence networks"
- Act 4: "Encrypted resistance communication channels"
- Act 5: "Secure fleet intelligence transmission protocols"

**Prerequisite for:** Compartmentalization (Cell Organizer)

#### Burn Notice
**Mechanical Effect:** Once per session, when an informant's cover is blown or they're about to be captured, you can automatically extract them from the situation without them being captured. This costs 1 Stress and may require you to abandon the operation or intelligence they were gathering. The informant is safe but their position/access is lost.

**Prerequisite:** Safe House Protocol

---

## Cell Organizer (Adept Tier)

**Advancement Trigger:** Organize a functional intelligence cell of 5+ people who don't know each other's identities

**Prerequisites:** Dead Drop Mastery OR Urban Intelligence Network

### Features:

#### Compartmentalization
**Mechanical Effect:** You can organize intelligence cells where members don't know each other's identities. When creating a cell:
- Define the cell's purpose and size (3-7 members)
- Spend 1 Stress to establish the cell
- Cell members can gather and pass intelligence without knowing the full network
- If one member is compromised, roll 1d6: on 4+, the rest of the cell remains secure

You can run up to 3 cells simultaneously.

**Act Interpretations:**
- Act 2: "Distributed scholarly research groups"
- Act 4: "Resistance cells with operational security"
- Act 5: "Compartmentalized intelligence collection units"

**Prerequisite:** Dead Drop Mastery  
**Prerequisite for:** Network Architecture (Master of Levers)

#### Network Resilience
**Mechanical Effect:** Your intelligence networks can survive infiltration and betrayal. When a network is compromised:
- You always know which specific node/informant was compromised
- You can spend 2 Stress to "cut out" the compromised element before it spreads
- Spend 3 Stress to feed false information through the compromised channel

**Prerequisite:** Loyalty Protocol  
**Prerequisite for:** Pattern Recognition Protocols (Local Network Handler)

#### Cell Coordination
**Mechanical Effect:** Passive +2 Edge when coordinating activities between multiple cells. You can task cells with intelligence gathering, counter-surveillance, or support operations. Each cell can handle one task per session without requiring your direct supervision.

---

## Local Network Handler (Expert Tier)

**Advancement Trigger:** Successfully run 3+ cells across one region simultaneously for at least 6 sessions

**Prerequisites:** 
- At least two features from Cell Organizer
- At least one feature from Political domain OR Economic domain

### Features:

#### Regional Intelligence Coordination
**Mechanical Effect:** You can coordinate intelligence flow across an entire region (city-state, province, or similar). Once per session, you can ask the GM for a "regional intelligence brief" covering:
- Major movements of people, goods, or forces
- Significant political developments
- Emerging threats or opportunities
- One hidden detail your network has uncovered

This brief reflects your network's collective observations.

**Act Interpretations:**
- Act 2: "Regional knowledge recovery coordination"
- Act 4: "Province-wide resistance intelligence"
- Act 5: "Planetary sector intelligence synthesis"

**Prerequisite for:** Cross-Cultural Intelligence (Cross-Realm Strings)

#### Pattern Recognition Protocols
**Mechanical Effect:** When you receive intelligence from at least 3 different sources, you can spend 1 Stress to identify patterns others miss. The GM must reveal one connection, contradiction, or hidden implication within the intelligence. This might reveal:
- False information or disinformation
- Coordinated activities across different areas
- The true source or target of an operation
- A larger pattern or conspiracy

**Prerequisite:** Network Resilience

#### Infiltration Detection
**Mechanical Effect:** +3 Edge when detecting counter-intelligence operations, infiltrators, or surveillance of your networks. Once per session, you can declare that you suspected someone was compromised and had been feeding them false information. Retroactively establish what false information you provided.

**Prerequisite for:** Counter-Intelligence Mastery (Cross-Realm Strings)

---

## Cross-Realm Strings (Master Tier)

**Advancement Trigger:** Establish intelligence networks in at least 3 different realms with different cultures

**Prerequisites:** 
- Regional Intelligence Coordination (Covert: Intelligence Networks)
- At least one feature from Political: Diplomacy OR Spiritual: Belief Systems

### Features:

#### Cross-Cultural Intelligence
**Mechanical Effect:** You can establish intelligence networks across cultural and linguistic barriers. You have reliable contacts in at least 3 different realms/cultures. You can:
- Pass intelligence through hostile territories without detection (spend 1 Stress)
- Translate intelligence reports across cultural contexts (what means "threat" in one culture vs another)
- Establish cross-cultural intelligence sharing protocols

+3 Edge when coordinating intelligence operations across multiple realms.

**Act Interpretations:**
- Act 2: "Multi-cultural knowledge exchange networks"
- Act 4: "Inter-realm rebellion coordination"
- Act 5: "Multi-world fleet intelligence coordination"

**Prerequisite:** Regional Intelligence Coordination  
**Prerequisite for:** Network Architecture (Master of Levers)

#### Information Transfer Protocols
**Mechanical Effect:** You can move information across hostile borders and through dangerous territory. Once per session, you can declare that critical intelligence has reached its destination despite obstacles. This costs 2 Stress if the route is actively hostile or monitored.

You can also establish "intelligence highways" - reliable routes for information flow that persist between sessions.

**Act Interpretations:**
- Act 2: "Scholarly correspondence across isolated regions"
- Act 4: "Resistance communications through occupied territory"
- Act 5: "Secure intelligence channels between fleet elements"

#### Counter-Intelligence Mastery
**Mechanical Effect:** You can identify and neutralize enemy intelligence operations. When you suspect counter-intelligence:
- Spend 1 Stress to confirm if your network is being monitored/infiltrated
- Spend 2 Stress to identify who is running the operation
- Spend 3 Stress to turn their operation against them (feed false intelligence, expose their agents, or recruit their informants)

**Prerequisite:** Infiltration Detection

---

## Master of Levers (Apex Tier)

**Advancement Trigger:** Use intelligence networks to prevent or enable a realm-scale event (war, treaty, revelation, coup)

**Prerequisites:**
- Network Architecture: Compartmentalization + Cross-Cultural Intelligence
- At least one feature from Political domain
- At least one feature from Economic domain OR Spiritual domain
- At least one Master-tier feature from Political: Diplomacy OR Spiritual: Belief Systems
- At least one Master-tier feature from Economic domain OR Spiritual domain

### Features:

#### Network Architecture
**Mechanical Effect:** Your intelligence network is now a strategic asset. You can:
- Mobilize information across continents within 1d6 days
- Run up to 10 simultaneous cells across multiple realms
- Coordinate intelligence operations involving 50+ people
- Establish intelligence protocols that persist without your direct management

Your network has +4 Edge on all intelligence operations. Your network's reputation precedes you - enemies know to watch for your involvement, allies seek your coordination.

**Act Interpretations:**
- Act 2: "Legendary keeper of recovered wisdom, coordinating planetary knowledge recovery"
- Act 4: "Rebellion spymaster general, nerve center of the resistance"
- Act 5: "Fleet intelligence architect, coordinating multi-world observation networks"

**Prerequisites:** Compartmentalization AND Cross-Cultural Intelligence

#### Strategic Intelligence Direction
**Mechanical Effect:** Once per episode, you can task your entire network with a strategic intelligence objective. The GM will reveal (over the course of 2-3 sessions):
- Deep background on a major faction or threat
- Advanced warning of a significant event
- The location of something critically important
- A hidden conspiracy or manipulation

This represents the combined effort of your entire intelligence apparatus focused on one question.

#### The Lever Moment
**Mechanical Effect:** Once per story arc (GM discretion on timing), when you have gathered sufficient intelligence, you can identify the **critical leverage point** - the single action that will cascade into realm-scale consequences. The GM must tell you:
- What the lever is
- What pulling it will accomplish
- What the costs and risks are
- Who else might be watching this same point

This doesn't guarantee success, but it gives you perfect intelligence on where to apply pressure to move the world.

**Act Interpretations:**
- Act 2: "Identify how recovered knowledge can transform regional culture"
- Act 4: "Find the weakness in dragon-backed occupation"
- Act 5: "Locate AF64's critical decision points"

## APEX DISCOVERY

**At Master of Levers tier, characters begin to notice:**

Your intelligence networks are *too* successful. Information flows too smoothly. Coincidences pile up. You start to suspect your networks are being *allowed* to exist - that something vast is observing your observations.

**GM Note:** This is AF64/dragons permitting and monitoring intelligence gathering. The networks work because they're useful to the actual powers. This realization should emerge gradually through play, not as a reveal.
