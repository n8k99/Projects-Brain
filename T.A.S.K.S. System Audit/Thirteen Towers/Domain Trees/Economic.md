# Economic Domain - The Thirteen Towers
## Trade, Resources, and the Material Foundation of Power

---

## Domain Overview

**Core Question:** "Who has resources and where does value flow?"

**Sphere of Influence:** Trade networks, resource control, logistics, supply chains, and the material infrastructure that enables or constrains power.

**What Economic Characters Shape:**
- Who controls critical resources (food, metals, luxuries)
- Where trade routes flow
- Which campaigns are logistically feasible
- How material wealth translates to political/military power

---

## Economic Domain Philosophy

Economic power on Orbis is often underestimated—but armies march on their stomachs, realms collapse without trade, and Monument infrastructure still requires material resources to maintain.

Economic mastery scales from:
- **Novice**: Local trader, merchant
- **Journeyman**: Guild master, trade coordinator
- **Adept**: Regional trade network controller
- **Expert**: Continental merchant prince
- **Master**: Economic kingmaker
- **Apex**: Control the material foundation of civilization

The Economic domain intersects with:
- **+ Martial:** Supply armies, starve enemies, fund wars
- **+ Covert:** Smuggling networks, economic intelligence
- **+ Political:** Trade treaties, economic dependencies
- **+ Spiritual:** Temple economies, pilgrimage trade
- **+ Magic/Tech:** Monument resource control

## Economic Trees

Three primary trees. Economic specialists often master 2-3 trees.

## Economic Domain Advancement Notes

**Typical Progression Pace:**
- Novice → Journeyman: Build successful trade or operation
- Journeyman → Adept: Establish regional presence
- Adept → Expert: Continental economic impact
- Expert → Master: Become essential infrastructure
- Master → Apex: Indispensable to civilization

**Multi-Tree Development:**
- Supply Networks + Resource Intelligence = Merchant Prince
- Supply Networks + Coordination & Logistics = Trade Coordinator
- Resource Intelligence + Coordination = Economic Strategist
- All Three Trees = The Plutocrat (rare, powerful)

**Domain Crossover Opportunities:**
- Economic + Martial = Mercenary Commander, Military Contractor
- Economic + Covert = Smuggling Kingpin, Economic Spy
- Economic + Political = Merchant Republic Leader
- Economic + Spiritual = Temple Economy Controller
- Economic + Magic/Tech = Monument Resource Trader

**Why Economics Matter:**

In a spy thriller about information and power, economics is often overlooked—but material reality constrains everything:
- Intelligence networks need funding
- Political alliances need trade incentives
- Military campaigns need supply
- Monument operations need resources

Economic specialists shape what's possible by controlling the material foundation.

**The Economic Endgame:**

Master/Apex Economic characters don't serve the powerful—they ARE economic power. They:
- Fund or starve governments
- Supply or cripple armies
- Create or destroy prosperity
- Make campaigns possible or impossible

They're not rich merchants. They're the economic infrastructure civilization depends on.

A Master Economic character can say "no" to a king—and make it stick.

An Apex Economic character can collapse realms by withdrawing support.
