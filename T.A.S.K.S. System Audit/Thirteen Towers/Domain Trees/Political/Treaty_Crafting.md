## APEX DISCOVERY

**At Eternal Covenant tier, characters realize:**

Your treaties create civilizational order. International law works. Conflicts are resolved peacefully. Cooperation is systematic and binding. You've built peace through treaty architecture.

And then you notice: treaty systems work *too* perfectly. Compliance is *too* universal. Enforcement is *too* effective. You start to suspect comprehensive treaty law has been *permitted*—that something vast finds binding international frameworks useful.

The horrible question: Have you created genuine peaceful order, or have you built the perfect legal cage? Do Dragons allow comprehensive treaty systems because binding international law makes human civilization easier to manage than anarchic chaos? When everyone follows the same legal framework, are they cooperating freely—or are they uniformly constrained?

Your eternal covenant might be the most sophisticated control system ever created—legal order that makes resistance legally impossible.

**GM Note:** This is the realization that international law might serve the Cull cycle—that Dragons permit comprehensive treaty systems because binding legal frameworks make human civilization predictable and manageable. The Eternal Covenant has created perfect international law that enables civilizational cooperation but also makes that cooperation easily monitored and controlled. The revelation should emerge gradually through play, not as a single moment.
