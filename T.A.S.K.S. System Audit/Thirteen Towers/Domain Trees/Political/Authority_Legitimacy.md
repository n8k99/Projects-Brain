## APEX DISCOVERY

**At God-King tier, characters realize:**

Your authority is absolute. Millions obey your word. Your decrees become reality. You are sovereign, divine, transcendent.

And then you notice: absolute authority was *permitted* to exist. Dragons allowed you to rise. Your sovereignty operates within boundaries. You start to suspect ultimate authority has been *managed*—that something vast finds god-kings useful.

The horrible question: Are you genuinely sovereign, or are you the most sophisticated kind of controlled? Do Dragons permit absolute human authority because god-kings are easier to manage than democratic chaos? When millions obey your word without question, are they free—or have you become the perfect administrative tool for harvesting?

Your transcendent authority might be exactly what Dragons wanted—centralized control that makes human populations manageable.

**GM Note:** This is the realization that absolute authority might serve the Cull cycle—that Dragons permit and even encourage centralized sovereignty because managing relationships with god-kings is simpler than managing fractious democracies. The God-King has achieved ultimate human authority, which makes them either the greatest threat or the greatest tool. The revelation should emerge gradually through play, not as a single moment.
