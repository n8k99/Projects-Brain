## Symbolic Combatant (Apex-adjacent)

**Advancement Trigger:** Your combat prowess becomes legendary, your duels have political weight

**Act Interpretations:**
- Act 2: "Living legend of martial prowess"

**DISCOVERS:** Personal combat skill matters far less than coordination, intelligence, and logistics. The best fighters prevent fights or use reputation to win without drawing blades.

**Note:** This tree caps at "Apex-adjacent" rather than true Apex because personal combat prowess, while impressive, doesn't have realm-shaping impact in the same way that command, authority, intelligence, or political skills do. It's valuable but not world-changing.
