# Unit Leadership Tree
## Commanding Formations and Leading Troops in Battle

This tree represents your ability to command troops, coordinate formations, and lead forces in battle. Unit Leadership specialists don't just fight—they multiply force through organization, tactics, and leadership. They turn rabbles into armies and good soldiers into devastating tactical assets.

Your reputation makes enemies cautious—which you can exploit.

Once per campaign, your reputation alone can cause enemy commander to make a critical mistake, second-guessing an opportunity that was actually genuine.

## APEX DISCOVERY

**At Theater Tactician tier, characters realize:**

Your armies succeed *too* consistently. Campaigns work out *too* well. Enemy mistakes happen *too* conveniently. You start to suspect your military genius has been *permitted* to flourish—that something vast finds legendary human commanders useful.

The horrible question: Have you become a genuine military master, or a tool for managing warfare within permitted parameters? Do Dragons allow great generals to exist because professional military excellence channels martial energy into controllable forms rather than revolutionary warfare?

When you command armies that win battles, are you protecting humanity—or just making human conflicts resolve neatly without threatening the larger system?

**GM Note:** This is the realization that military excellence might exist by design—that Dragons permit great generals because professional armies with hierarchical command structures are easier to manage than popular uprisings or irregular warfare. The Theater Tactician has perfected the art of war within permitted boundaries, which makes them extremely dangerous to other humans but potentially harmless to the true power structure. The revelation should emerge gradually through play, not as a single moment.
