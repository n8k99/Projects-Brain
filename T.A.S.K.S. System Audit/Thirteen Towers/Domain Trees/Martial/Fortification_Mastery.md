# Fortification Mastery Tree
## Designing, Building, and Breaking Defensive Positions

This tree represents your ability to design fortifications, conduct sieges, and understand defensive warfare. Fortification Mastery specialists know how to turn terrain into advantage, create impregnable defenses, and break seemingly impossible positions. In a world of walled cities and Tower fortresses, those who understand fortification determine which armies survive.

**Fictional Scale:** Build Barricade → Design Fortress → Master Siege Engineer

- At least one Master-tier feature from Political OR Covert domain
- At least one Expert-tier feature from any third domain
- At least one Master-tier feature from Magic/Tech domain

### Features:

#### Impregnable Design
**Mechanical Effect:** You design fortifications that cannot be taken by assault. You have +4 Edge on all fortification design.

Your fortresses:
- Have never fallen to direct attack when properly garrisoned
- Resist all known siege techniques
- Can be held indefinitely with adequate supplies
- Become legendary defensive positions

Enemies must invest overwhelming resources to even attempt sieges of your fortifications—and usually fail anyway.

**Act Interpretations:**

#### Psychological Fortification
**Mechanical Effect:** Your fortresses' reputations demoralize attackers:
- Enemies facing your fortifications have -1 Edge
- Besiegers' morale declines rapidly
- Stories of your defensive successes spread
- Rulers hesitate to attack positions you've designed

Your fortifications win battles through reputation before fighting begins.

Once per major siege, besieging forces must make Spirit saves or refuse to assault your fortifications, choosing blockade instead.

#### The Master's Knowledge
**Mechanical Effect:** You can identify how to break ANY fortification:
- Your own designs (you know the weaknesses)
- Enemy fortifications (you understand principles)
- Ancient defensive works (you recognize patterns)
- Natural defensive positions (you see vulnerabilities)

When assessing fortifications:
- Spend 3 Stress to identify the critical weakness
- GM must reveal how the position could be taken
- You understand exactly what's required

This makes you invaluable for both defense and offense—you design impregnable fortresses and know how to break others'.

## APEX DISCOVERY

**At The Unbreakable tier, characters realize:**

You've built fortifications that cannot be taken. Sieges fail. Assaults are repulsed. Your defensive works are legendary. Realms depend on your designs for security.

And then you notice: fortification warfare is *permitted*. Dragons don't destroy your fortresses. They allow siege warfare to occur. Conventional military conflict operates within boundaries.

The horrible question: Have you created genuine security, or have you perfected the cage? Do Dragons allow fortification mastery because defensive warfare keeps human conflicts conventional and predictable? When you build impregnable fortresses, are you protecting humans—or creating better containers for harvesting?

Your fortifications might be the most sophisticated method of population control ever designed—strong enough to protect against other humans, but ultimately irrelevant against the true power structure.

**GM Note:** This is the realization that fortification warfare might serve the Cull cycle—that Dragons permit and even encourage conventional siege warfare because it channels military energy into controllable forms that don't threaten Dragon supremacy. The Unbreakable has perfected defensive warfare, which makes human conflicts manageable but leaves Dragon power unchallenged. The revelation should emerge gradually through play, not as a single moment.
