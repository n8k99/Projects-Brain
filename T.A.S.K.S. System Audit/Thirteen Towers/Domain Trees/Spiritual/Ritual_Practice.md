## APEX DISCOVERY

**At Eternal Liturgy tier, characters realize:**

Your rituals define how civilization creates meaning. All major life transitions use your ceremonies. Communities organize around your ritual calendar. You've built the sacred infrastructure for human culture.

And then you notice: ritual practice persists *too* perfectly. Your ceremonies spread *too* easily. Communities adopt your frameworks *too* readily. You start to suspect ritual systems have been *permitted* to flourish—that something vast finds comprehensive ceremonial practice useful.

The horrible question: Have you created genuine sacred meaning, or have you built sophisticated social control? Do Dragons allow ritual systems because coordinated ceremonial practice makes populations predictable and manageable? When communities gather for your rituals, are they creating authentic meaning—or are they practicing synchronized behavior that's easier to monitor and control?

Your eternal liturgy might be the perfect pacification mechanism—giving humans meaning that doesn't threaten the system.

**GM Note:** This is the realization that ritual systems might serve the Cull cycle—that Dragons permit and even encourage comprehensive ceremonial frameworks because ritual provides meaning that channels energy into symbolic rather than material resistance. The Eternal Liturgy has created profound sacred practice that sustains human culture while potentially making that culture easier to harvest. The revelation should emerge gradually through play, not as a single moment.
