# Resource Intelligence Tree
## Information About Material Resources, Trade, and Economic Activity

This tree represents your ability to gather, analyze, and weaponize economic intelligence. Resource Intelligence specialists know where resources are, who controls them, what they're worth, and how to use that information strategically. In a world where supply determines what's possible, economic intelligence is profound power.

**Fictional Scale:** Market Watcher → Economic Analyst → Resource Oracle

## Market Sense (Novice Tier)

**Advancement Trigger:** Successfully predict market trends or identify profitable opportunities that prove accurate

**Prerequisites:** None

### Features:

#### Price Assessment

When entering a market, you automatically know:
- Fair prices for common goods
- Whether current prices are high, low, or normal
- Recent price trends (rising, falling, stable)
- Seasonal or cyclical factors affecting prices

This prevents you from being cheated and helps you spot opportunities.

**Act Interpretations:**
- Act 2: "Valuing recovered artifacts and knowledge"
- Act 4: "Assessing resistance supply costs and availability"
- Act 5: "Understanding human-fleet trade economics"

**Prerequisite for:** Market Analysis (Economic Analyst)

#### Price Manipulation Detection
**Mechanical Effect:** You can spot when prices are being manipulated:
- Artificial scarcity through hoarding
- Price fixing by cartels or monopolies
- Speculation creating bubbles
- Dumping to drive out competition

When examining market conditions, you can identify:
- Who's benefiting from current prices
- Whether prices reflect genuine supply/demand
- Signs of coordinated market manipulation

Once per session, spend 1 Stress to force the GM to reveal who's manipulating a market and how.

**Act Interpretations:**
- Act 2: "Detecting artificial knowledge scarcity"
- Act 4: "Identifying occupation economic manipulation"
- Act 5: "Spotting AF64 resource control mechanisms"

#### Local Supply Intelligence
**Mechanical Effect:** You understand local supply and demand patterns:
- What goods are abundant vs. scarce
- Who the major buyers and sellers are
- Seasonal variations in availability
- How goods flow through the local economy

You maintain awareness of economic conditions—you notice when things change and can identify why.

### Features:

#### Market Analysis
**Mechanical Effect:** You gather and analyze economic intelligence systematically. You have +2 Edge on economic intelligence gathering.

You track:

**Prerequisite for:** Predictive Economics (Resource Forecaster)

#### Economic Impact Prediction
**Mechanical Effect:** You can predict economic consequences of events before they manifest:
- War disrupting trade routes → price increases

- Political instability → capital flight

When major events occur, you know which markets will be affected and how. This allows you to:
- Position yourself advantageously
- Warn allies of coming shortages
- Exploit price movements for profit
- Advise leaders on economic implications

**Prerequisite for:** Strategic Forecasting (Resource Forecaster)

#### Economic Intelligence Network
**Mechanical Effect:** You maintain a network of economic informants who provide ongoing intelligence:

- Market brokers report price movements

Your network provides passive economic intelligence—the GM periodically gives you updates on significant economic developments without requiring specific investigation.

Once per session, you can task your network to investigate a specific economic question and receive answer within 1d6 hours.

- At least one Master-tier feature from any other domain

### Features:

#### Comprehensive Economic Intelligence
**Mechanical Effect:** You know the economic reality of all major realms and factions. You have +3 Edge on all economic intelligence.

You know:
- What they can actually afford (vs. what they claim)

## APEX DISCOVERY

**At See the Economy tier, characters realize:**

You see the complete economic reality of civilization. Every trade flow, every resource movement, every hidden wealth cache. You understand the system perfectly.

And then you notice: the economic system is *designed*. Resource flows follow patterns that shouldn't be coincidental. Critical dependencies exist that serve specific purposes. The economy isn't emergent—it's architected.

The horrible question: Are you seeing genuine economic reality, or are you seeing the carefully maintained economic control system? Do Dragons permit economic intelligence networks because having humans who understand the economy makes it easier to manage economic levers?

When you predict economic outcomes, are you forecasting natural market forces—or just predicting the next phase of designed economic management?

**GM Note:** This is the realization that the entire economic system might be carefully maintained by AF64/Dragons to create specific dependencies and resource flows that serve the Cull cycle. The Accountant sees the economy completely—but the economy itself is a control mechanism. Perfect economic knowledge reveals the cage is economic, not just political or military. The revelation should emerge gradually through play, not as a single moment.
