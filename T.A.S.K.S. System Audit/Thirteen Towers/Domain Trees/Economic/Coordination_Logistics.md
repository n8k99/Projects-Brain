# Coordination & Logistics Tree
## Managing Complex Operations and Resource Allocation

This tree represents your ability to coordinate complex operations, manage logistics, and allocate resources efficiently. Coordination & Logistics specialists turn plans into reality through systematic organization, ensuring that resources arrive where needed when needed. In a world where ambition outpaces capability, those who master logistics determine what's actually possible.

**Fictional Scale:** Project Manager → Campaign Coordinator → Continental Operations Master

## APEX DISCOVERY

**At Invisible Hand tier, characters realize:**

You coordinate everything. Every major operation flows through your logistics. Your coordination makes civilization function. Nothing significant happens without your systems.

And then you notice: logistics coordination works *too* efficiently. Resources flow *too* smoothly. Your systems integrate *too* perfectly. You start to suspect civilizational logistics has been *permitted* to centralize—that something vast finds comprehensive coordination useful.

The horrible question: Have you created efficient logistics, or have you built the perfect control infrastructure? Do Dragons allow centralized coordination because tracking one comprehensive logistics system is easier than monitoring distributed local supply chains? When you coordinate everything, are you enabling civilization—or making it easier to manage and harvest?

Your invisible hand might be exactly what Dragons wanted—total visibility into resource flows and human organization.

**GM Note:** This is the realization that centralized logistics might serve the Cull cycle—that Dragons permit and even encourage comprehensive coordination systems because they provide perfect intelligence on human capabilities, resources, and organization. The Invisible Hand has created the most efficient logistics infrastructure possible, which is also the most easily monitored and controlled. The revelation should emerge gradually through play, not as a single moment.
