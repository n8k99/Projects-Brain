## How NPCs React to New Information

### Tier 0 → Tier 3 (Cull Cycle Revelation)

**Denial:** "Impossible. The dragons protect us."
**Despair:** "We're doomed. Nothing matters."
**Anger:** "We must kill every dragon!"
**Pragmatism:** "How do we survive the next one?"

### Tier 3 → Tier 5 (AF64/Origins Revelation)

**Existential Crisis:** "We're not even from Orbis?"
**Betrayal:** "AF64 watched and did nothing!"
**Hope:** "We have allies inside the system."
**Determination:** "Now we know who to negotiate with."

### Tier 5 → Tier 6 (Galactic Context)

**Overwhelm:** "Too big. I'm just one person."
**Ambition:** "A whole galaxy? We should claim our place."
**Caution:** "Galactic politics could doom us."
**Vision:** "This is our chance to reshape everything."

## Using Knowledge Gradients in Play

1. **Before introducing NPC, assign tier**
2. **NPC can only reveal information at or below their tier**
3. **NPCs can advance tiers through story events**
4. **Players teaching NPCs = dramatic scenes**

### Example: Same NPC Across Campaign

**Theron, Court Scholar**

**Episodes 1-40 (Tier 2):**
"The old texts speak of a First Civilization, before even the elves. They reached heights we can barely imagine, then fell to hubris and dragon wrath."

**Episodes 41-60 (Tier 3 - discovers Cull cycle):**
"Gods help us. I found records in the sealed archives. This has happened EIGHT times. Every thousand years, like clockwork. We're not recovering from the First Civilization. We're the NINTH."

**Episodes 61-85 (Tier 4 - explores Tower):**
"These aren't buildings. Look at this chamber — rows of sleeping pods. This is a SHIP. We came from somewhere else. The 'gods' who blessed us are... I don't know what they are, but they came WITH us."

**Episodes 86+ (Tier 5 - meets AF64):**
"Her name is Maya. She's been here since the Landing — 10,000 years, watching. They made a deal with the dragons to save us. All of it — the Culls, the manipulation, even the bloodlines — it was to see if we could survive knowing the truth."
