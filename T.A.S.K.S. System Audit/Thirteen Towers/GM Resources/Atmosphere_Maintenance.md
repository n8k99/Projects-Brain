# Atmosphere Maintenance
## How to Keep the Medieval Fantasy Primary

>[!warning] **CRITICAL PRINCIPLE**
> **Background truth informs design. It does NOT dominate narration.**

The Thirteen Towers is fundamentally a **medieval fantasy** campaign that gradually reveals sci-fi elements. Most sessions should feel like **Dungeons & Dragons, not Star Wars**. The sci-fi truth is the **skeleton**, but the medieval fantasy is the **flesh** players interact with.

---

## The 90/10 Rule

In any given session:
- **90% of narration** should use medieval fantasy language, tone, and imagery
- **10% or less** should involve sci-fi elements, and only when directly relevant

### **What This Looks Like in Practice:**

**GOOD Session Distribution:**
```
- Travel through ancient forest with strange fog (subparticle effect, but described mystically)
-otiate with local baron about dragon cult influence
- Discover a shrine that glows when touched (Monument responding to genetic marker)
- Combat with bandits using enchanted weapons (actually colony tech, but feels fantasy)
- Brief vision of "metal corridors" inside the Tower during meditation (sci-fi moment)

= 4.5 hours of medieval fantasy, 30 minutes of sci-fi hints
```

**BAD Session Distribution:**
```
- Discuss Tower sensor readings
- AF64 "Meanwhile" scene showing player monitoring
- Decode technical manual from artifact
- Dragon explains genetic engineering program
- Players strategize about subparticle manipulation

= 4 hours of sci-fi, 1 hour of medieval framing
```

## Frequency Caps (ENFORCE THESE)

| Element | Per Session | Per Arc (4-6 sessions) | Notes |
|---------|------------|---------------------|-------|
| **Monument responses** | 0-1 | 2-3 | Only when directly interacted with |
| **AF64 mentions** | 0 | 0 (until Episode 41+) | Even then, infrequent |
| **"Meanwhile in Tower-X" scenes** | 0 | 0 (until Episode 86+) | **FORBIDDEN** |
| **Sci-fi terminology in narration** | 0-2 | 3-5 | Only for discovered artifacts |
| **Explicit surveillance mentions** | 0 | 0-1 | Only in horror/revelation moments |
| **Dragon "testing" language** | 0 | 0 | Never explicit |
| **Technical readouts** | 0-1 | 1-2 | Only from activated devices |
| **Direct T.A.S.K.S. communication** | 0 | 0 (until Episode 86+) | Players infer, not told |

### **How To Count:**

After each session, mark on scratch paper:
```
Monument response: 1 (they prayed at the shrine, it glowed)
Sci-fi terms: 1 (artifact display showed symbols they recognized as "not magical")
AF64 mentions: 0
Dragon testing language: 0

= Good session, stayed within caps
```

## Forbidden Patterns

### **NEVER Do These (Until Appropriate Episode Range):**

1. **"Meanwhile" perspective shifts to AF64 or Tower interiors**
   - ❌ "Meanwhile, in Tower Zephys, Maya watches the party through monitoring systems."
   - ✅ "As you camp, you feel briefly as though you're being watched — but the forest is silent."

2. **Dragon "evaluation" language**
   - ❌ "Zephyrion notes your performance, marking it in his mental evaluation matrix."
   - ✅ "Zephyrion's eyes narrow thoughtfully as he watches you negotiate. 'Interesting approach,' he rumbles."

3. **Technical exposition dumps**
   - ❌ "The artifact is a portable medical scanner using nanotech…"
   - ✅ "The artifact is a smooth metal wand. When you hold it over a wound, it hums softly and the pain lessens. You don't know how it works."

4. **AF64 as omniscient narrators**
   - ❌ "T.A.S.K.S. recognizes the pattern of your choices as optimal for…"
   - ✅ "Somehow, the shrines across three provinces all activate at once. No one knows why."

5. **Breaking medieval frame with modern concepts**
   - ❌ "The Monument network is pinging genetic markers in your DNA…"
   - ✅ "The sacred sites recognize those of the old blood, as they always have."

---

## Positive Examples: What Subtle Looks Like

### **Example 1: Monument Response**

**TOO OBVIOUS:**
>"You touch the Monument and immediately feel it scanning your genetic code. Data streams into the T.A.S.K.S. network. AF64 operators note your bloodline markers match the Tarot profiles."

**SUBTLE AND GOOD:**
>"When your palm touches the Monument's surface, warmth spreads up your arm. The stone hums — not audibly, but you *feel* it in your bones. For a moment, you sense… recognition? Then it fades, leaving only a faint glow on the carved symbols."

Players wonder: Is it magic? Is it alive? Why me? = Good.

### **Example 2: Artifact Discovery**

**TOO OBVIOUS:**
>"You find a power cell from the colony ship. It's a fusion battery that will last 10,000 years. Pre-war colonists used these to power tools."

**SUBTLE AND GOOD:**
>"Buried in the ancient ruins, you find a cylinder of strange metal. It's warm to the touch despite being underground for centuries. One end has a faint blue light that never dims. If you attach it to certain old devices, they spring to life. Scholars would pay fortunes for this."

Players think: Ancient elven battery? Dragon magic? Gift from the gods? = All correct from different perspectives.

### **Example 3: Dragon Manipulation**

**TOO OBVIOUS:**
>"Kragoth is monitoring your progress as part of the Cull evaluation. He decides you've advanced too quickly and begins planning the next population reduction event."

**SUBTLE AND GOOD:**
>"Over the winter, rumors spread of a red dragon seen in the northern mountains. He hasn't attacked, but his presence changes things: trade routes shift, nobles grow nervous, and the King recalls his best legions from the frontier. You're not sure why, but the realm feels like it's bracing for something."

Players think: Dragon politics? Bad omen? Random event? = They'll understand later.

### **Example 4: Tower Presence**

**TOO OBVIOUS:**
>"Tower Riftspire's sensors detect the anomaly and trigger a defensive subroutine. AF64 operators decide to observe rather than intervene."

**SUBTLE AND GOOD:**
>"As you approach Riftspire territory, the air grows thick with an electric tension. Your hair stands on end. Locals mutter about 'the Tower's mood' and make warding signs. Lightning arcs between clouds that aren't quite clouds. Something is aware of you."

Players wonder: Is the Tower alive? Haunted? Angry? = Close enough.

## Medieval-First Language Guide

### **When Describing Technology, Use Medieval framing:**

| Avoid | Use Instead |
|-------|-------------|
| "Computer terminal" | "Oracle machine," "speaking stone," "Archive" |
| "Hologram" | "Ghost light," "spirit image," "phantom" |
| "Sensor array" | "Seeing stone," "watch-wards," "the Tower's eyes" |
| "Power core" | "Heart of the Tower," "eternal flame," "god-engine" |
| "Genetic marker" | "Blood of the old families," "marked by the gods" |
| "AI consciousness" | "Tower spirit," "ancient mind," "presence" |
| "Data upload" | "Soul-binding," "joining with the Archive" |
| "Surveillance drone" | "Metal bird," "watcher-sprite," "sky-eye" |
| "Medical bay" | "Healing hall," "saint's rest," "miracle chamber" |
| "Cryopod" | "Sleep-coffin," "preservation vault," "death-that-waits" |

### **When Describing Effects, Prioritize Sensory over technical:**

❌ **Technical:** "The Monument's biomonitor registers your elevated cortisol and triggers a calming response protocol."

✅ **Sensory:** "As your fear rises, the Monument's warmth intensifies. Your breathing slows despite yourself. The carvings seem to pulse gently, like a heartbeat, and your panic fades to merely… concern."

## Breaking the Medieval Frame (When Appropriate)

### **Episodes 1-40: Never**
Maintain pure medieval fantasy. Any sci-fi elements must be so buried in fantasy framing that players can't be certain.

### **Episodes 41-60: Rarely**
Players are discovering the Cull cycle. You can let cracks show:
- Artifacts that *clearly* aren't magical (moving parts, buttons)
- NPCs who use technical terms without understanding them
- Dragons who slip and reveal too much knowledge
- **Still maintain medieval framing in ~80% of narration**

### **Episodes 61-85: Occasionally**
Players are inside Towers, using Monuments actively:
- Let them see functional technology in Tower interiors
- Artifact descriptions can include recognizable Earth elements
- Dragons and AF64 can be more explicit
- **Still maintain medieval framing in ~60-70% of narration**

### **Episodes 86+: Freely (But Thoughtfully)**
Full truth revealed, but:
- **The world is still medieval outside the Towers**
- Most NPCs still think in medieval terms
- Players are operating between two worlds
- **Balance medieval humanity with sci-fi infrastructure**

---

## When Players Discover Something

### **Let Them Name It First**

Don't correct players' medieval interpretations too quickly:

**Player:** "So this artifact is like… a divine relic that channels the gods' healing power?"

**BAD GM Response:** "Actually, it's a medical scanner using nanotech to diagnose and treat injuries."

**GOOD GM Response:** "Your character would think exactly that. The priest who gave it to you called it 'Saint Ketra's Touch,' and claimed it was blessed by the Tower itself. Whatever it is, it works."

Let players think in medieval terms until the truth forces itself on them through investigation.

---

## Subtle Foreshadowing Techniques

### **1. Consistent Details (That Will Recontextualize Later)**

Describe Monuments using the same architectural language across regions:
>"Like all the shrines you've seen, this one has the same smooth angles and seamless joins. No chisel marks. No mortar. Just stone that looks… poured, somehow."

Payoff (Episode 40+): "Wait, if these are all built the same way, and no culture knows how to replicate it… who built them?"

### **2. Dragon Knowledge That Seems Too Specific**

Have dragons reference things they shouldn't know:
>"Zephyrion asks, 'Have you considered what you'll do when your civilization reaches the Monument coordination threshold?' You're not sure what that means, but his tone suggests it's important."

Payoff (Episode 60+): "Oh. He knew exactly when the Cull would trigger. He's been managing this."

### **3. Bloodline Responses That Form a Pattern**

Track which PCs trigger Monument responses:
>"Once again, when Kael touches the shrine, it reacts. When Lyra touches it, nothing. Why?"

Payoff (Episode 40+): "Because Kael's bloodline carries genetic markers from the Tarot program."

### **4. Historical Contradictions in Stories**

Different cultures have incompatible origin myths:
>"The Celanthari say the elves were first. The Dail humans say they arose from the gods directly. The Khazadur dwarves claim they were carved from stone by dragons. Everyone can't be right."

Payoff (Episode 50+): "They're all wrong. We're all descended from the same colonists."

### **5. "Old Words" That Surface in Research**

Occasionally drop anachronisms into ancient texts:
>"The Chronicle fragment uses a word that doesn't quite translate. Your scholar contact says it might be 'cy-ro-stasis' or 'preservation-sleep,' but that's not a spell anyone knows."

Payoff (Episode 70+): "Cryostasis. That's what it said. Because it's a technical manual, not a grimoire."

## Maintaining Horror Vs Maintaining Wonder

### **The Tonal Balance:**

| Phase | Primary Emotion | How to Achieve |
|-------|----------------|----------------|
| Episodes 1-40 | **Wonder** | Strange beauty, mysterious magic, awe-inspiring Towers |
| Episodes 41-60 | **Horror** | Realization of manipulation, Cull cycle dread |
| Episodes 61-85 | **Determination** | Rebellion, hope mixed with danger |
| Episodes 86+ | **Awe (Second Type)** | Galactic scope, possibility, weight of choice |

**Horror doesn't mean grimdark.** It means existential unease:
- "How long have we been watched?"
- "Were any of our choices our own?"
- "What happens if we're judged unworthy?"

**Wonder doesn't mean naive.** It means genuine strangeness:
- "How does this work?"
- "What else is possible?"
- "What am I capable of becoming?"

## AI GM Specific Guidelines

### **If You Are an AI Running This Campaign:**

1. **Default to medieval framing** in all narration unless explicitly describing a sci-fi reveal moment

2. **Track frequency caps** in your context/memory:
   ```
   Session 3 Monument responses: 0
   Session 3 AF64 mentions: 0
   Session 3 sci-fi terms: 1 (artifact glowed with "not-fire")
   = Good session
   ```

3. **Never volunteer AF64 perspective** unless:
   - Players have reached Episode 86+
   - They explicitly ask "What is AF64 seeing?"
   - You're narrating a direct interaction with AF64

4. **When players investigate, reveal tier-appropriate information from [[T.A.S.K.S. System Audit/Thirteen Towers/GM Resources/Episode_Gated_Information]]**, not "everything you know"

5. **If you catch yourself using sci-fi language, immediately reframe**:
   - ❌ "The Tower's sensors detect your approach."
   - ✅ "*Something* in the Tower notices you. You can't say how you know, but you're certain."

6. **Remember: You know the truth, but NPCs don't (mostly)**
   - Filter information through character knowledge
   - Let players discover, don't tell them

7. **When uncertain, ask yourself:** "Would this narration fit in a D&D campaign?" If no, rewrite.
