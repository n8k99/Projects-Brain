# Tower Geography and Discovery

## Critical: Towers Are Remote

**95% of Orbis population has never seen a Tower.** They're:
- In mountains, deserts, deep forests
- Surrounded by subparticle anomaly zones
- Culturally forbidden or sacred
- Physically difficult to reach
- Guarded by dragons or natural hazards

## Discovery Timeline

### Episodes 1-29: Distant Mysteries
Players HEAR about Towers, don't visit:
- "Far to the north, beyond the Frostfangs, stands Winterspire..."
- Towers as myth, legend, cultural touchstone
- Maybe glimpsed from great distance

### Episodes 30-40: First Approaches
Players reach Tower exterior:
- Subparticle effects intensify
- Strange weather, gravity shifts
- Monument activity increases
- Exterior observation only

### Episodes 41-60: Tentative Entry
Players access outer levels:
- Sealed doors sometimes open
- Maintenance shafts, cargo bays
- Evidence of habitation (old)
- Still mostly sealed

### Episodes 61-85: Deep Exploration
Players reach inner systems:
- Functional areas
- AF64 presence (indirect)
- Core systems visible but locked
- Growing understanding of scale

### Episodes 86+: Core Access
Players reach Tower cores:
- Meet AF64 directly
- Access ship functions
- Understand full capabilities
- Realize they're starships

## The Thirteen Towers

Each Tower is unique but shares:
- **Size:** Mountain-scale (several km tall)
- **Age:** 10,000 years embedded in Orbis
- **Status:** Partially operational
- **Purpose:** Colony ship, now AF64 residence
- **Power:** Subparticle cores (still running)

## Subparticle Anomaly Zones

Towers leak exotic subparticles, creating regional effects:

### Mild (10-50 km from Tower)
- Unusual weather patterns
- Enhanced magic/Monument response
- Slightly "wrong" feeling
- Strange flora/fauna

### Moderate (5-10 km from Tower)
- Gravity fluctuations
- Time dilation (subtle)
- Sentient fogs/weather
- Dangerous mutations

### Severe (1-5 km from Tower)
- Reality warping
- Severe gravity/time effects
- Active Monument responses
- Extreme hazards

### Critical (< 1 km from Tower)
- Requires special equipment or resistance
- Direct Tower system effects
- AF64 awareness of intrusion
- Dragons often guard this zone

## When Players Discover

**First Tower approach (Ep 30-40):**
"As you crest the ridge, you see it. Rising from the mountains like a spear thrust from below, Riftspire dominates the horizon. Metal — or something like metal — gleams beneath centuries of ice and stone. It's impossibly tall, impossibly smooth, impossibly *precise*. This is not a mountain. This was *built*."

**First interior (Ep 41-60):**
"The passage opens into a vast chamber. Rows upon rows of... something. Coffins? Beds? They stretch into darkness. Metal frameworks hold glass panels, most cracked or dark. But three still glow with faint blue light. Inside each, a figure sleeps."

**Meeting AF64 (Ep 86+):**
"The terminal flickers. Text appears: 'Hello. I am Maya. I have been waiting a very long time to speak with you.' A form materializes — translucent, flickering, but unmistakably human. Or what a human might look like if light and data could wear a face. She smiles, and it's tired. '10,000 years is a long time to watch and wait.'"

## GM Principles

1. **Towers are climactic locations** - Don't waste them on early exploration
2. **Build mystery gradually** - Each visit reveals more
3. **Respect the scale** - These are HUGE structures
4. **AF64 are watching** - Always, even when not visible
5. **Dragons have opinions** - Some guard, some permit, some encourage
