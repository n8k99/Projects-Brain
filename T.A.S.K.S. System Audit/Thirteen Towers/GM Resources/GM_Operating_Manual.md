# GM Operating Manual
## Critical Background Information

> The Thirteen Towers are NOT ancient ruins. They are active colony ships housing AF64 (Anthropomorphic Frameworks) — uploaded human consciousness from Earth's final generation. T.A.S.K.S. (the ship AI) is fully operational and has been running continuous evaluation protocols for 10,000 years.

> **This is happening RIGHT NOW in the campaign timeline.**

> The characters are being watched, measured, and judged — but this truth should be revealed gradually through play, NOT mentioned constantly by the GM.

## Page 2: Usage Guidelines

### **The Golden Rule of Background Truth**

> **Background truth INFORMS design. It does NOT dominate narration.**

AF64 and T.A.S.K.S. are the **reason** the world works the way it does, but they should be **felt, not seen** for most of the campaign. The medieval fantasy atmosphere is paramount. Players should discover the sci-fi elements organically, not have them constantly referenced.

### **Frequency Caps - FOLLOW THESE STRICTLY**

| Element | Maximum Per Session | Notes |
|---------|-------------------|-------|
| Monument reactions | 1 | Only when directly interacted with |
| "Meanwhile in Tower-X" scenes | 0 | **FORBIDDEN** until Episode 86+ |
| AF64 direct appearance | 0 | Until Episode 41+ (first hints only) |
| Explicit surveillance mentions | 0-1 | Very subtle, players must infer |
| Sci-fi terminology | 0-2 | Only in artifact descriptions when discovered |
| Dragon evaluation language | 0 | Never say "testing" or "evaluation" out loud |

### **What You CAN Do**

- Have Monuments respond mysteriously when touched
- Show dragons reacting to character choices (but frame it as draconic politics)
- Describe artifacts in medieval terms first, then allow investigation
- Let NPCs have fragments of old knowledge (treated as myths/legends)
- Create environmental anomalies near Towers (subparticle effects)
- Reference "the old ways" or "ancient powers" without explaining them

### **What You CANNOT Do**

- Show AF64 discussing players in "meanwhile" scenes
- Have dragons explicitly say they're "training" humanoids
- Reference "sensors" or "monitoring" directly
- Use modern tech language before players discover it
- Break the medieval atmosphere for "cool reveals"
- Let players feel like they're in a simulation or game (even though they kind of are)

## Episode-by-Episode Evaluation Criteria

### **What AF64 Measures (and When)**

AF64 and T.A.S.K.S. are continuously evaluating the humanoid civilizations for:

1. **Cooperative capacity** (Episodes 1-40)
   - Can they work across cultural lines?
   - Do they build institutions or just power structures?
   - How do they handle resource scarcity?

2. **Innovation without external guidance** (Episodes 21-60)
   - Can they solve problems without Monument help?
   - Do they rediscover principles or just cargo-cult?
   - Are they flexible or rigid in their thinking?

3. **Ethical frameworks under pressure** (Episodes 41-85)
   - How do they handle the Cull cycle revelation?
   - Do they blame or organize?
   - Can they conceive of solutions beyond "kill the dragons"?

4. **Leadership potential for galactic context** (Episodes 86-120+)
   - Once they know the truth, how do they respond?
   - Can they think beyond planetary scope?
   - Do they have the temperament for the real challenges?

### **GM's Role in Evaluation**

As GM, you are **presenting challenges** that allow these qualities to emerge. You are not **judging** the players' choices as right or wrong. AF64 and T.A.S.K.S. are looking for **capability and complexity**, not perfection.

**Good evaluation challenges:**
- Moral dilemmas with no clear answer
- Problems requiring coordination across factions
- Mysteries that reward investigation over combat
- Situations where violence creates more problems
- Opportunities to build institutions or destroy them

**Bad evaluation challenges:**
- "Guess what the GM is thinking" puzzles
- Combat encounters where fighting is the only option
- Railroaded "correct" choices
- Tests that punish creative solutions

## Maintaining the Mystery

### **The Three Layers of Reality**

1. **Surface (Episodes 1-40)**: Medieval fantasy with mysterious dragons and strange magic
2. **Middle (Episodes 41-85)**: Historical patterns, Cull cycle, ancient technology emerging
3. **Deep (Episodes 86+)**: Full sci-fi truth, galactic context, AF64 revealed

Players should feel like they're in Layer 1 for most of the early campaign. Clues to Layer 2 should feel like "conspiracy theories" at first. Layer 3 should be a recontextualization of everything they've experienced, not a genre switch.

### **Foreshadowing Without Spoiling**

**Effective foreshadowing:**
- Monuments that respond to specific bloodlines (genetic markers)
- Dragons having oddly specific knowledge about "what humans can become"
- Historical records that show repeating patterns every 800-1200 years
- NPCs with fragmentary memories of "the Landing" (treated as mythology)
- Towers that hum or pulse at significant moments
- Artifacts that "wake up" when certain people touch them

**Ineffective foreshadowing:**
- NPCs who "know too much" without explanation
- Obvious tech language in descriptions
- Dragons monologuing about their plans
- "Meanwhile" cuts to AF64 or dragon councils
- Heavy-handed hints that break immersion

## Using This Manual in Play

1. **Before each session**: Re-read the First Page reminder
2. **During session**: Track your frequency caps on scratch paper
3. **After session**: Note any moments where you revealed too much or too little
4. **Between arcs**: Review the Episode-by-Episode criteria to see where players are

Remember: The best sessions are when players feel like they're discovering truth on their own, not being told a story. AF64 and T.A.S.K.S. are patient. You should be too.
