2. Choose archetype that resonates
3. Read full deep-dive guide for that archetype
4. Use "Roleplaying Questions" to develop character
5. Review "Domain Paths" to see how your archetype approaches different trees

**During Play**:
- Reference "When You Get Edge" for mechanical bonuses

- Use "Moral Friction Triggers" to understand when acting against archetype increases Difficulty

**Advancement**:
- Follow "Advancement Advice" for each tier
- Review example characters for inspiration
- Use "Domain Paths" to plan multi-domain progression

### For GMs

**Session Prep**:
- Review player archetypes before session
- Design situations that **challenge** archetype principles (create Moral Friction opportunities)
- Create NPCs of different archetypes for contrast
- Use "Archetype Dilemmas" to create compelling choices

**During Play**:

- Highlight archetype conflicts between PCs (Edgerunner vs Oathbound, Shieldbearer vs Silentknife)

**Campaign Design**:
- Each archetype has different **endgame** (see Master/Apex examples)
- Archetypes approach same domain **differently** (use "Domain Paths" sections)
- High-tier archetypes shape the world (Masters and Apex characters are realm-changing)

## Archetype Combinations & Conflicts

### Natural Alliances

**Shieldbearer + Oathbound**: Both value duty, honor, sacrifice
**Songbearer + Linekeeper**: Both preserve (meaning + memory)
**Silentknife + Patternweaver**: Both value preparation and intelligence
**Linekeeper + Oathbound**: Both value tradition and continuity

### Creative Tensions

**Shieldbearer + Silentknife**: Open protection vs surgical strikes
**Oathbound + Edgerunner**: Constraint vs freedom
**Patternweaver + Edgerunner**: Planning vs improvisation
**Songbearer + Linekeeper**: New narratives vs preserved tradition

### Fundamental Conflicts

**Edgerunner + Oathbound**: Freedom vs sworn constraint (core opposition)
**Linekeeper + Edgerunner**: Tradition vs boundary-pushing (philosophical conflict)

---

## Multi-Archetype Characters

**Can you be multiple archetypes?**

**No—mechanically, you choose one archetype.**

But characters can have **elements** of multiple archetypes:
- Primary archetype: Grants Edge, defines core principles
- Secondary influences: Flavor roleplay, inform choices

**Example**: Primary Shieldbearer with Oathbound elements
- Gets Edge from protection (Shieldbearer)
- Also has oath-based principles (Oathbound flavor)
- In conflict, Shieldbearer takes precedence mechanically

Talk with your GM about blended archetypes.

---

## Archetype Evolution

**Can archetypes change?**

**Yes—through major character transformation.**

If a character experiences **fundamental identity change**:
- Oathbound breaks their oath permanently → Becomes Edgerunner (freedom from broken bonds)
- Edgerunner accepts permanent commitment → Becomes Oathbound (embracing constraint)
- Shieldbearer fails to protect, becomes obsessed with understanding → Becomes Patternweaver

**This is rare and should be major character arc, not casual change.**

Discuss with GM before changing archetype.

## Design Notes

### Why Archetypes?

**Archetypes aren't combat classes**—they're **ethical frameworks**.

In many RPGs, "class" defines **what you can do** (mechanically).

In Thirteen Towers, **Domain Trees** define what you can do (Combat Prowess, Intelligence Networks, etc.).

**Archetypes** define **who you are** (ethically, methodologically).

This separation allows:
- Any archetype can pursue any domain (Silentknife Politician, Shieldbearer Spy)
- Character identity isn't tied to mechanical capability
- Moral choices have mechanical weight (Moral Friction system)

### Archetype vs Domain

**Archetype**: Who you are, how you approach problems
**Domain**: What you can do, institutional power you wield

Example:
- **Silentknife + Martial Domain** = Precision fighter (sniper, duelist)
- **Shieldbearer + Martial Domain** = Defensive protector (guardian, bodyguard)
- **Oathbound + Martial Domain** = Honor-bound warrior (knight, champion)

**Same domain, different archetype = completely different character.**
