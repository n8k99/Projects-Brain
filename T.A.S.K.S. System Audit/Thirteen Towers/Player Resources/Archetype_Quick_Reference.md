# Archetype Quick Reference
## Character Types in The Thirteen Towers

---

## What Are Archetypes?

Archetypes are **ethical and moral frameworks** that define:
- How you approach problems
- What you risk and protect
- Your core values and methods
- When you get Edge bonuses

**Important**: Archetypes are NOT combat classes. Any Archetype can develop any Domain Tree. They define your approach, not your capabilities.

## Using Your Archetype

### In Play

1. **Describe your approach** using your Archetype's values
2. **Claim Edge** when acting in your archetypal mode
3. **Face challenges** when your values conflict with pragmatism

### Edge from Archetypes

Archetype Edge is usually **+1 to +2** when you're clearly acting in character.

**Example**:
> Shieldbearer jumping in front of an arrow meant for an ally: +2 Edge to Body roll to intercept

> Patternweaver who prepared trap using gathered intelligence: +2 Edge to spring the trap effectively

### Archetypes and Domains

**Any Archetype can pursue any Domain.**

- **Shieldbearer Covert Operative**: Protects intelligence sources and networks
- **Songbearer Economic Factor**: Uses cultural knowledge to broker trade deals
- **Patternweaver Martial Commander**: Analyzes battle patterns and plans strategy
- **Silentknife Political Operator**: Carefully removes obstacles to alliance-building

Your Archetype colors **how** you approach the Domain, not **which** Domains you can access.
