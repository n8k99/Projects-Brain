# Equipment Lists
## Weapons, Armor, and Gear for Orbis

---

## How Equipment Works

Equipment in The Thirteen Towers uses **Tags** to grant mechanical benefits and fictional permissions. Most equipment provides:
- **Edge bonuses** when relevant
- **Fictional permissions** (what you can attempt)
- **Narrative flavor** (how you look and operate)

**Important**: Equipment grants Edge, but remember the **Edge cap of +5 total**. You can't stack equipment bonuses endlessly.
