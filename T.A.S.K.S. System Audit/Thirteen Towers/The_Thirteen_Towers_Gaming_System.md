# Part 1: Welcome to Orbis

## What Is This Game?

The Thirteen Towers is a **narrative-focused, medium-crunch** tabletop RPG emphasizing:

### Investigation Over Combat
This is a **spy thriller in fantasy clothing**. Your primary tools are intelligence gathering, social maneuvering, and careful planning. Combat exists but is dangerous and often avoidable.

### Consequence-Driven Play
Success and failure drive the story forward. There are no dead ends, only complications. Failed rolls don't mean "nothing happens" - they mean "something happens, and you won't like it."

### Domain Expertise Matters
Your characters develop institutional power through six domains: **Martial, Covert, Magic/Tech, Spiritual, Economic, and Political**. A master of the Covert domain shapes what is known and hidden. A master of the Political domain shapes who holds power and why.

### Secrets Layered Upon Secrets
Orbis is not what it seems. The medieval fantasy setting gradually reveals science fiction underpinnings. Players uncover this truth through investigation, discovery, and dangerous curiosity.

---

## The World of Orbis

### The Known World

Orbis is a **post-collapse civilization** recovering from an ancient catastrophe known only as "The Shattering." It has been **5,246 years** since the collapse (5,246 After Year Zero, or AY).

The world is organized around **Thirteen enormous Towers** - mysterious structures that predate civilization, cannot be entered, and seem to watch the world with silent intent. Around these Towers, civilizations have grown, realms have formed, and power structures have calcified.

### The Dragons

Seven immortal beings called **Dragons** administer Orbis. They are:
- Ancient beyond mortal comprehension
- Rarely seen but always present
- Absolute in their authority
- Utterly uninterested in explaining themselves

The Dragons maintain order through:
- **Monuments** - Ancient structures that provide infrastructure (gates, healing, communication)
- **Treaties** - Enforced agreements between realms
- **Direct intervention** - Rare but devastating when it occurs

### The Surface Reality

To most people, Orbis is a medieval fantasy world:
- Knights and nobles govern realms
- Merchants trade across provinces
- Temples venerate gods and spirits
- Magic exists in the form of Monuments and relics
- Dragons are incomprehensible forces of nature

This is the **90% truth** - the reality players interact with daily.

### The Hidden Truth

Beneath the fantasy veneer lies a science fiction reality:
- The "Towers" are actually **starship colony vessels**
- The "Dragons" are **AI administrators** maintaining the colony
- "Monuments" are **colony infrastructure** (3D printers, medical bays, gates)
- "Orbis" is a **terraformed planet** settled by humans from Earth
- "The Shattering" was a **catastrophic systems failure** 5,000 years ago

This is the **10% truth** - revealed gradually through investigation.

---

## Tone and Atmosphere

### The 90/10 Rule

**90% of play** should feel like **medieval fantasy** (Game of Thrones, Dragon Age)
**10% of play** should involve **sci-fi hints** (The Matrix, Westworld)

### What This Looks Like

**Typical Session**:
- Negotiate with local baron about rebellion
- Investigate strange shrine in ancient forest
- Combat with bandits using enchanted weapons
- Brief vision of "metal corridors" inside a Tower during meditation

**NOT Typical**:
- Decode technical manuals
- Discuss sensor readings
- Strategize about AI programming

The sci-fi truth is the **skeleton**. The fantasy reality is the **flesh** players interact with.

---

## What Players Do

In The Thirteen Towers, you:

### 1. Gather Intelligence
- Infiltrate organizations
- Build spy networks
- Decode ancient texts
- Map power structures

### 2. Navigate Politics
- Broker alliances
- Negotiate treaties
- Leverage secrets
- Build institutional power

### 3. Uncover Secrets
- Investigate Monuments
- Study Tower phenomena
- Discover pre-Shattering artifacts
- Learn uncomfortable truths about the world

### 4. Make Hard Choices
- Uphold your principles or compromise for results
- Protect allies or pursue the mission
- Share dangerous knowledge or keep it buried
- Work within Dragon authority or resist it

### 5. Shape the Realm
As you advance through Domain Trees, your influence grows from personal to realm-shaping. High-tier characters don't just win fights - they **move armies, reshape economies, and rewrite power structures**.

---

# Part 2: Core Rules

## The Core Mechanic

When you attempt a risky action with uncertain outcome:

> **Roll 1d20 + Stat Modifier + Edge**
>
> **Compare to Difficulty**
>
> **Success**: Beat the Difficulty → You achieve your goal
> **Partial**: Exactly meet Difficulty → You succeed with complication
> **Failure**: Below Difficulty → You don't achieve the goal (and consequences happen)

### Example

**Situation**: You're trying to pick a lock on a noble's study while guards patrol nearby.

**GM**: "This is Difficulty 14. You're in Risky Position - if you fail, the guards will notice. Roll Reflex + Edge."

**You**: "I have REF 16 (+3 modifier), and I'm using my Lockpicking Tools (+1 Edge). I roll… 9 on the d20."

**Total**: 9 (d20) + 3 (REF) + 1 (Edge) = **13**

**Result**: Partial success - you get the lock open, but it takes longer than expected. The guards are approaching…

---

## The Eight Stats

Your character has eight core attributes:

| Stat | Abbreviation | What It Governs |
|------|--------------|----------------|
| **Body** | BOD | Strength, endurance, physical power |
| **Reflex** | REF | Speed, agility, reaction time |
| **Charm** | CHM | Persuasion, presence, social influence |
| **Sense** | SEN | Perception, awareness, reading situations |
| **Spirit** | SPR | Willpower, conviction, mental resistance |
| **Mind** | MND | Intellect, memory, reasoning |
| **Luck** | LCK | Fortune, synchronicity, improbable success |
| **Will** | WIL | Determination, grit, pushing through adversity |

### Stat Modifiers

Stats range from 6 to 20+ (higher is better):

| Score | Modifier |
|-------|----------|
| 6-7   | -2 |
| 8-9   | -1 |
| 10-11 | +0 |
| 12-13 | +1 |
| 14-15 | +2 |
| 16-17 | +3 |
| 18-19 | +4 |
| 20+   | +5 |

---

## Edge (Modifiers)

**Edge** is a single situational modifier that combines all advantages and disadvantages.

**Range**: -5 to +5 (typically -3 to +3)

### Sources of Edge

1. **Archetype** - Your character type grants Edge in specific situations
2. **Domain Expertise** - Your area of specialization
3. **Tree Nodes** - Specific abilities you've unlocked
4. **Situation** - Fictional advantages (preparation, tools, position, leverage)
5. **Tags** - Equipment, reputation, or context descriptors

### The Golden Rule: One Edge Number

**Don't stack individual bonuses**. Discuss the situation with the GM and agree on a single Edge value that represents your total advantage or disadvantage.

**Example**:
- You're a Silentknife (precision striker) attacking from ambush
- You have the "Assassin" tag and a poisoned blade
- You've studied the target's schedule for a week

**Bad**: "+1 for Archetype, +1 for tag, +1 for poison, +1 for preparation = +4"
**Good**: "You're perfectly positioned. This is +3 Edge total."

---

## Position & Effect

Before you roll, the GM establishes:

### Position (How Much Risk?)

**Controlled**: Low risk, minimal consequences
- You have leverage, preparation, or overwhelming advantage
- Failure means setback, not disaster

**Risky**: Moderate risk, real consequences
- Standard dangerous situation
- Failure means harm, complications, or lost resources

**Desperate**: High risk, severe consequences
- You're outmatched, cornered, or improvising badly
- Failure could mean death, capture, or catastrophic loss

### Effect (How Much Impact?)

**Limited**: Partial progress, small change
- You're working against serious obstacles
- Success moves you forward incrementally

**Standard**: Normal success, expected result
- The default outcome for most actions
- Success achieves what you set out to do

**Great**: Major success, significant change
- You have exceptional leverage or ability
- Success exceeds expectations or solves multiple problems

---

## Difficulty Bands

The GM sets Difficulty based on how hard the task is:

| Difficulty | Band | When to Use |
|------------|------|-------------|
| **8** | Trivial | Trained people succeed routinely (average roll beats it) |
| **12** | Standard | Real risk for average person, skilled people handle it |
| **16** | Hard | Requires expertise, preparation, or advantages |
| **20+** | Extreme | Needs exceptional ability, perfect setup, or extraordinary luck |

### Adjusting Difficulty

- **Position doesn't change Difficulty** - it changes consequences
- **Effect doesn't change Difficulty** - it changes scope of success
- **Moral Friction** increases Difficulty when acting against principles
- **Draconic Attention** is separate from Difficulty (see Advanced Rules)

---

# Part 3: Characters

## Character Creation

Creating a character in The Thirteen Towers is a **structured, story-first** process:

### Step 1: Concept & Culture

Choose your character concept and cultural background:

**Available Cultures**:
- Dail Human (widespread, adaptable)
- Celanthari High Elves (ancient, ritualistic)
- Elfish (general)
- Lothian Dark Elfish (shadow-touched)

- Khazadur Dwarves (cosmopolitan, trading)
- Halfling Valewardens (community-focused)
- Yotunn Giants (powerful, long-lived)
- Etrivalian (nomadic, steppe cultures)

Each culture has minor stat modifiers and social context.

### Step 2: Generate Stats

**Method A - Standard Array**: Assign these values to your 8 stats:
**14, 12, 12, 10, 10, 8, 8, 6**

**Method B - Rolled Stats**: Roll 4d6 drop lowest, add 1d4, apply cultural modifiers

### Step 3: Choose Background Profession

What did you do before becoming an operative?

Examples: Soldier, Scholar, Merchant, Noble, Criminal, Priest, Artisan, Sailor

Your background grants:
- Starting competencies (knowledge/skills)
- Social connections
- Resources or equipment

### Step 4: Select Archetype

Choose one of the Seven Archetypes (detailed below). This defines your ethical framework and grants situational Edge bonuses.

### Step 5: Choose Primary Domain

Select one of the Six Domains as your starting focus. You begin with basic competency and can unlock your first Tree node during play.

### Step 6: Define Principles

List 3-5 core principles your character holds. Acting against these triggers **Moral Friction** (increased Difficulty).

### Step 7: Starting Resources

- **Hit Points**: 10 + (Body modifier × 2), minimum 8
- **Resolve**: 3 + (higher of Spirit or Will modifier), minimum 3
- **Defense**: 10 + Reflex modifier + armor bonus
- **Equipment**: Based on background (see Equipment Lists)

---

- **Novice** (entry-level ability)
- **Journeyman** (solid competence)
- **Adept** (specialist)
- **Expert** (master of the craft)
- **Master** (realm-renowned)
- **Apex** (legendary, world-shaping)

### Unlocking Nodes

To unlock a node, you must **complete its fictional trigger** in play.

**Example** (Martial Domain, Combat Prowess Tree):

**Journeyman: Weapon Specialist**
- *Trigger*: Defeat a notably skilled opponent in single combat, OR train intensively with a master
- *Effect*: +2 Edge with chosen weapon style, can reroll failed attack once per combat

You advance by **doing the thing**, not by grinding XP.

---

# Part 4: Playing the Game

## When to Roll

Only roll when **all three** are true:
1. **Outcome is uncertain**
2. **Failure has consequences**
3. **Success matters to the story**

### Don't Roll When…

- The outcome is guaranteed (competent character doing routine task)
- Failure wouldn't create interesting story
- Time isn't a factor and you can retry

---

## Combat System

### Battle Order (Initiative)

At the start of combat:
1. Everyone rolls **1d20 + Reflex modifier**
2. GM ranks results: highest acts first
3. Ties go simultaneously

### Your Turn: Standard Actions

On your turn, you can:

**Move**: Engage/disengage from an enemy, reposition, take cover

**Attack**: Roll to hit vs target's Defense
- Roll: 1d20 + appropriate Stat + Edge
- Success: Roll weapon damage
- Critical (natural 20): Double damage or special effect

**Defend**: Gain +2 Defense until your next turn

**Help**: Grant ally +1 Edge on their next action

**Special Action**: Use a Tree node ability or complex maneuver

### Attack Resolution

**To Hit**: 1d20 + Stat + Edge vs Target's Defense

**On Success**: Roll weapon damage
- Light weapons (dagger): 1d6
- Medium weapons (sword): 1d8
- Heavy weapons (greataxe): 1d10
- Two-handed weapons: Add +2 damage

**On Miss**: No damage, but fiction progresses

---

## Harm and Consequences

### Hit Points

**HP** represents your ability to avoid serious injury. When you reach 0 HP, you're **Incapacitated** (unconscious, helpless, or near death).

### The Harm Track

Instead of just HP damage, consequences can be:

**Level 1 Harm** (-1 to rolls): Minor wound, exhaustion, stress
**Level 2 Harm** (-2 to rolls): Serious wound, broken bone, trauma
**Level 3 Harm** (-3 to rolls): Critical wound, life-threatening injury
**Level 4 Harm**: Incapacitated, requires immediate help or die

### Non-HP Consequences

Failed rolls can result in:
- **Position degraded**: Controlled → Risky → Desperate
- **Resources lost**: Gear, money, contacts
- **Time lost**: Patrols arrive, deadlines pass
- **Attention gained**: Draconic Attention, enemy notice
- **Access denied**: Doors close, routes blocked
- **Trust broken**: Allies doubt you, enemies learn your patterns

---

## Social Conflicts

Social interactions use the same core mechanic:

**Persuade/Deceive**: Roll CHM + Edge vs Difficulty
**Intimidate**: Roll SPR + Edge (or weapon display) vs Difficulty
**Insight** (read someone): Roll SEN + Edge vs their CHM + Edge

### Leverage Matters

Social Edge comes from:
- What you know (secrets, information)
- What you offer (rewards, threats, promises)
- Who you are (reputation, authority, connections)
- Context (formal settings, private meetings, public spectacle)

---

## Investigation

Investigation is the **core loop** of Thirteen Towers.

### Clue Gathering

**You can't fail to find clues that advance the plot.**

If you look in the right place with appropriate skills, you find the clue. The roll determines:
- How much time it takes
- What complications arise
- How much context you get

### Information Network

Build intelligence networks through:
- Recruiting informants
- Planting spies
- Bribing officials
- Trading secrets

This unlocks **Intelligence Networks** Tree nodes (Covert Domain).

---

# Part 5: The World

## The Thirteen Towers

Massive structures that predate civilization:

**Known Facts**:
- They cannot be entered (all attempts fail)
- They seem to watch and observe
- They affect local reality (anomalies, strange weather)
- They were here before the Shattering

**Names of the Towers**:
1. The Pinnacle (central authority)
2. Solspire (light and energy)
3. Shardspire (crystalline structure)
4. Stormspire (weather control)
5. Glacial Pillar (frozen north)
6. Flamekeep (volcanic heat)
7. Bloomspire (life and growth)
8. Abyssal Beacon (deep sea)
9. Riftspire (dimensional anchor)
10. Verdant Bastion (forest heart)
11. GloamingWatch (shadow realm)
12. Mists of Veilspire (obscured knowledge)
13. The Panopticon (central observation)

Each Tower has **True Names** (their actual designations) hidden in Chronicle fragments.

---

## The Dragons

The seven immortal administrators:

**What They Do**:
- Maintain Monument infrastructure
- Enforce treaties between realms
- Prevent realm-shaking catastrophes
- Preserve stability and order

**What They Don't Do**:
- Explain their decisions
- Intervene in local politics (usually)
- Answer prayers or worship
- Die or age

**The Truth**: They are artificial intelligences running the colony's administrative systems.

---

## Monuments and Relics

**Monuments** are ancient structures providing services:

**Common Monuments**:
- **Travel Gates**: Instant transport between connected gates
- **Healing Shrines**: Accelerated recovery from injury
- **Archive Monuments**: Libraries containing pre-Shattering knowledge
- **Communication Monuments**: Long-distance messaging

**How They Work** (surface explanation): Ancient magic, Dragon-maintained, poorly understood

**How They Actually Work**: Colony infrastructure - 3D printers, medical bays, quantum gates, data storage

---

## Realms and Factions

Orbis is divided into sovereign realms centered on the Towers:

**Major Realms**:
- **Solarian Empire** (Solspire) - Imperial authority, sun worship
- **Shardhold Confederacy** (Shardspire) - Merchant republic
- **Stormwarden Kingdoms** (Stormspire) - Warrior culture
- **Glacian Territories** (Glacial Pillar) - Isolation, harsh survival
- (And others - see Setting Gazetteer)

**Key Factions**:
- **Tower Scholaria** - Researchers studying the Towers
- **The Silent Registry** - Shadow organization tracking information
- **Monument Keepers** - Priests maintaining Monument access
- **Dragon Heralds** - Official representatives of Dragon will

---

# Part 6: Advanced Rules

## Moral Friction

When you act against your stated **Principles**, the GM increases Difficulty:

| Violation Severity | Difficulty Increase |
|-------------------|-------------------|
| Minor Bend | +2 |
| Significant Compromise | +4 |
| Core Betrayal | +6 |

**Example**: A Shieldbearer who abandons their post faces +4 Difficulty on actions during that betrayal.

**Purpose**: Make character identity mechanically relevant while allowing principled characters to make hard choices.

*Full rules in [[T.A.S.K.S. System Audit/Thirteen Towers/Core Rules/07_Moral_Friction]]*

---

## Draconic Attention

When you perform actions that affect realm stability, the GM may roll a **Draconic Attention Check**:

**GM rolls**: 1d20 + Severity Modifier vs Difficulty 15

**On success**: Dragons notice (+1 to Attention Tracker)
**At 5 Attention**: Dragons intervene directly

**Trigger Examples**:
- Approaching within 1 mile of a Tower (+4 severity)
- Manipulating Monument functions beyond normal use (+4 to +6)
- Major political upheaval (+4)
- Discovering Earth-Age truths (+8)

**Purpose**: Make Tower investigation and truth-seeking dangerous; create tension around discovery.

*Full rules in [[T.A.S.K.S. System Audit/Thirteen Towers/Core Rules/08_Draconic_Attention]]*

---

## Tags and Descriptors

**Tags** are short phrases that grant Edge or fictional permissions:

**Character Tags**: "Monument Savant" (+2 Edge with Monuments), "Noble Born" (+1 Edge in aristocratic contexts)

**Equipment Tags**: "Exceptional Weapon" (+1 Edge), "Blessed Blade" (+1 vs spiritual threats)

**Location Tags**: "Fortified" (+2 Defense for defenders), "Trade Hub" (+1 Edge on commercial negotiations)

**Situation Tags**: "Flanked" (-1 Defense), "Higher Ground" (+1 Edge on attacks)

*Full library in [[T.A.S.K.S. System Audit/Thirteen Towers/Player Resources/Tag_Library]]*

# Part 7: For Game Masters

## Running the Game

### The GM's Principles

1. **Fiction first, mechanics second** - The story determines what's possible
2. **Telegraph consequences** - Tell players Position and Difficulty before they roll
3. **Make failure interesting** - Failed rolls advance the plot with complications
4. **Respect player expertise** - High-level characters should feel competent
5. **Layer secrets** - Not all mysteries resolve; some lead to deeper questions

### Session Structure

**Opening**: Recap previous session, establish current situation
**Development**: Players pursue goals, GM presents obstacles and opportunities
**Complications**: Consequences from previous actions surface
**Cliffhanger**: End on tension or revelation

---

## The Five Act Structure

The campaign follows a **five-act arc** of escalating revelation:

**Act 1 - Local Mysteries** (Sessions 1-8)
- Players investigate local anomalies and politics
- Rumors of ancient secrets surface
- First contact with Monument mysteries

**Act 2 - Regional Intrigue** (Sessions 9-16)
- Realm-level conspiracies emerge
- Players gain institutional power
- Tower proximity reveals strangeness

**Act 3 - Continental Crisis** (Sessions 17-24)
- Multi-realm threats develop
- Chronicle fragments suggest deeper truths
- Dragons become more active

**Act 4 - Truth Revealed** (Sessions 25-32)
- Players discover the starship nature
- Confrontation with Dragon administrators
- Choice: work within system or resist

**Act 5 - Resolution** (Sessions 33-40)
- Players shape the future of Orbis
- Their decisions have realm-shaking consequences
- Campaign concludes with new status quo

---

## Information Gating

**Control what players learn and when.** Not all NPCs know the truth. Most believe the fantasy surface reality.

**NPC Knowledge Tiers**:
- **Tier 0** (commoners): Surface reality only
- **Tier 1** (scholars): Ancient history, Monument basics
- **Tier 2** (Tower Scholaria): Monument theory, Tower observations
- **Tier 3** (Dragon agents): Partial truth, functional understanding
- **Tier 4** (Dragons): Complete truth

Players advance through investigation and discovery.

*Full guidelines in [[T.A.S.K.S. System Audit/Thirteen Towers/GM Resources/Episode_Gated_Information]]*

## Designer's Notes

### Why This System?

**Single Resolution Mechanic**: One roll resolves an entire action. No extended checks or multiple rolls for the same task.

**Position/Effect Framework**: Stolen from *Blades in the Dark* because it elegantly handles risk vs reward without complex subsystems.

**Domain-Based Progression**: Allows non-combat characters to participate meaningfully. A master of the Covert domain is as powerful as a master swordsman, just in different contexts.

**Investigation Focus**: The genre (spy thriller) requires mechanics that reward information gathering and planning over combat prowess.

**Bounded Math**: Edge capped at ±5 prevents runaway modifier stacking and keeps math simple.

### Influences

- *Blades in the Dark* (Position/Effect, fiction-first mechanics)
- *Burning Wheel* (advancement through use, Beliefs)
- *D&D 5e* (bounded accuracy, advantage/disadvantage as single modifier)
- *GUMSHOE* (investigation as core loop)
- *Fate* (tags and aspects)
