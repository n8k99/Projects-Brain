### **The Veilstorm Accord**
```ad-attention
### **Description**:
An alliance between blue and black dragons who sought to reshape the southern coastline into a haven of perpetual storms and submerged dominions. The **Stormreaver Conclave**, a group of elemental mages, served as mortal allies in this endeavor.

### **Goal**:
To create a coastal kingdom where dragons could rule unchallenged from storm-shrouded islands and marshes.

### **Tactics**:

The Veilstorm Accord unleashed devastating hurricanes, lightning storms, and flood surges, forcing entire coastal settlements to evacuate. Their mortal followers enhanced the storms with arcane rituals.

### **Downfall**:

The metallic dragons **[[MaltherionArbiterOfDragonkind]]** and **[[AurenstraalTheDawnwingAscendant]]** formed a defensive coalition with the [[LuminarianEmpire]]and launched a counter-assault. The final battle, known as the **Tempestfall Reprieve**, ended when the ritual storm anchor was destroyed, dispelling the unnatural storms and scattering the Veilstorm dragons.
