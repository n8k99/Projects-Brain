# **Draconic Factions**

The **draconic factions** of Orbis stand as a testament to the primal and cosmic influence of dragons over the mortal world. These factions, whether organized around allegiances among dragons or mortal worshipers, form the unseen but potent power that shapes the rise and fall of kingdoms, defines ancient wars, and inspires legends across the ages. Dragons, as creatures of immense magical and physical power, often embody forces that mortals cannot comprehend or control. They weave their ambitions and rivalries into the very fabric of the world, and their influence spans from high mountain peaks to the hidden depths of the seas.

At the heart of these draconic factions are the **[[T.A.S.K.S. System Audit/Thirteen Towers/Dragons/02 Chromatic Alliances/ChromaticAlliances|Chromatic Alliances]]**, forged by the more destructive and tyrannical chromatic dragons. These coalitions are often fueled by greed, wrath, and ambition, uniting powerful but volatile dragons under temporary pacts of mutual benefit. Such alliances rarely last forever, as betrayal and mistrust run deep within the chromatic psyche. Nevertheless, when these alliances are strong, they are capable of bringing entire civilizations to ruin, burning cities to ash, flooding continents, and sowing terror that echoes for generations.

In contrast, the **[[T.A.S.K.S. System Audit/Thirteen Towers/Dragons/03 Metallic Guardians/Metallic Guardians]]*** represent dragons who view themselves as custodians of balance and protectors of the innocent. Gold, silver, brass, bronze, and copper dragons form sacred pacts to safeguard mortals, sacred sites, and cosmic nexuses. However, even metallic dragons can become entangled in moral conflicts about the extent of their guardianship. Should they directly intervene in mortal affairs or act as distant watchers? These questions create tension among the metallic dragons, some of whom walk the fine line between protector and authoritarian ruler. This internal divide often mirrors the very struggles faced by the civilizations they protect.

Perhaps the most unsettling of draconic factions are the **[[DragonCults]]**, mortal factions that pledge their lives and souls to specific dragons. These cults can range from religious devotees who revere their dragon lords as gods to cunning conspirators who use draconic alliances to gain political or military power. The most dangerous cults often operate in secrecy, embedding themselves in courts, guilds, and councils, sowing discord and creating fanatical movements that reshape history. Some cults are created from devotion, others from fear, and a select few from the corruptive allure of draconic power. These cults not only serve their draconic patrons but often act as a critical link between dragonkind and the mortal races, either fostering cooperation or destruction.

The draconic factions of Orbis also reflect deeper truths about the world itself. The very essence of Orbis, shaped by its unique subparticle phenomena, resonates with draconic nature. The planet is a crucible of growth, destruction, and rebirth, much like the dragons who inhabit it. These factions do not merely contend with each other in battles of might—they also vie for control over the towers, magical ley lines, and planar rifts that hold the secrets of ancient power. The towers themselves, relics of the colonists who arrived thousands of years ago, have attracted draconic attention for millennia. Some dragons see the towers as artifacts of power to be unlocked, while others believe they are dangerous relics that should remain dormant.

Understanding the draconic factions of Orbis is crucial for any adventurer, ruler, or scholar who seeks to survive the world’s ever-shifting political and magical landscape. Draconic influence is woven into every level of society, from the legends whispered around village hearths to the proclamations of monarchs whose lands border dragon territories. Whether revered, feared, or opposed, dragons and their followers shape the destiny of Orbis in ways both subtle and cataclysmic.

In the sections that follow, we will explore the intricate dynamics of draconic factions: the ambitions of the Chromatic Alliances, the sacred duty of the Metallic Guardians, and the dangerous allure of the Dragon Cults. Each of these factions offers unique narrative potential, illustrating the complex and often tenuous relationship between dragons and mortals. By understanding these factions, adventurers can better navigate the draconic machinations that pulse through Orbis—and perhaps one day, shape the balance of power between dragonkind and the mortal world.

# Dragon Cults

The influence of dragons extends far beyond their physical presence. Across Orbis, there are those who seek out draconic power, forming cults and covenants in service to these mighty beings. These factions can range from devoted worshipers who view dragons as divine entities to secretive conspirators using draconic influence for political gain. Some cults form out of reverence or fear, while others are coerced or enslaved by draconic magic. Regardless of their origins, dragon cults play a significant role in the shaping of Orbis, acting as both catalysts for upheaval and bridges between mortal and draconic ambitions.

## Types of Dragon Cults

Not all dragon cults share the same purpose or structure. Their goals, practices, and level of autonomy often vary based on the nature of their draconic patron.

### **Reverent Cults**:
Devoted followers who revere their draconic patron as a divine figure or elemental force  
- **Beliefs and Rites**: Reverent cults worship dragons as gods, elemental forces, or celestial protectors. Members believe that by serving their draconic patron, they gain protection, blessings, or enlightenment.  
- **Example**: The **Burning Ascendants** revere Ignarath the Scorched Tyrant as the living embodiment of flame’s purity. Their rites involve walking barefoot over embers, symbolizing their devotion to destruction as a path to renewal.  
- **Symbols and Vestments**: Reverent cults often wear robes and adornments that reflect their dragon’s nature—bronze scales for storm worshipers, fire-lit brands for flame cults, or twilight-patterned cloaks for shadow-bound disciples.  

### **Covenants Of Conspiracy**:
Cults that form secret alliances with dragons to amass political power  
- **Goals and Methods**: These cults often act as covert organizations, embedding themselves within mortal courts, guilds, and factions to influence policies and amass wealth and power. They see their draconic patrons as allies or tools for their ambition.  
- **Example**: The **Clawbound Syndicate** in Myranth serves a cunning blue dragon who provides intelligence and magical aid in exchange for loyalty. The Syndicate controls key trade routes and funds mercenary groups to enforce their dominance.  
- **Rituals**: Members of conspiratorial covenants often undergo initiation rites that bind them to the draconic pact, such as drinking from an enchanted goblet imbued with their dragon’s essence. These rituals often grant temporary but dangerous magical powers.  

### **Servants Of the Brood**:
Groups who are directly enslaved or manipulated by draconic magic  
- **Control and Fear**: Unlike reverent cults or conspiratorial covenants, these factions are bound by fear or magical coercion. Enslaved cultists may serve as foot soldiers, enforcers, or expendable agents, controlled by their draconic master’s will.  
- **Example**: The **Scaled Sorrow**, a cult bound to Vraxxar the Skybreaker, consists of captured storm-callers and mages whose minds have been twisted by elemental storms. They act as thralls who create chaos in his name.  
- **Symbols of Subjugation**: Servants of the brood often bear visible signs of their enslavement, such as draconic brands, glowing eyes, or skin altered by prolonged exposure to draconic magic.

## **Major Dragon Cults and Their Operations**

Some dragon cults are known across Orbis due to their infamous deeds or their far-reaching influence.

![[Emberborn]]

### **The Veilbound Covenant**
- **Dragon Patron**: Serynthra of the Umbral Depths (Black Dragon)  
- **Beliefs**: The Veilbound Covenant views Serynthra as the shadow between realms, a being who reveals hidden truths through fear and chaos. They believe that only those who embrace the darkness can truly know the world’s secrets.  
- **Operations**: The Veilbound Covenant operates as an assassin’s guild, targeting political figures to spread fear and unrest. They often leave behind cryptic messages in the form of shadow-carved runes that dissolve at dawn.  
- **Skyward Rite**: During full moons, members gather at secluded marshlands to invoke Serynthra’s attention through rituals involving obsidian idols and sacrifices.  

### **The Auric Choir**
- **Dragon Patron**: **Zaldrith the Ember Voice** (Brass Dragon)  
- **Beliefs**: The Auric Choir believes that mortals must be “reforged” through trials of fire and hardship to ascend into true greatness. Though their patron is a benevolent brass dragon, their interpretations of his teachings have become extreme.  
- **Operations**: The Auric Choir travels between settlements, hosting rites of purification where willing mortals undergo dangerous tests of endurance involving fire and illusions. Many view the Choir as misguided zealots rather than true villains.  
- **Song of Renewal**: The Choir’s signature ritual involves hymns sung in draconic, said to bolster the courage of the strong and expose the fears of the unworthy.

## **Infiltration And Influence**

Dragon cults thrive on their ability to influence and manipulate mortal society.

### **Political Subversion**
Many dragon cults work in the shadows, embedding themselves in noble courts, guilds, and religious orders. By swaying key figures, they gain control over trade routes, military decisions, and territorial expansion.  
#### **The Whisperer’s Gambit**:
Veilbound agents have been known to orchestrate assassinations disguised as supernatural omens, driving rulers into paranoia and making them easier to control.  
#### **The False Prophecy**:
Some cults fabricate prophecies that predict destruction unless their draconic patron is appeased, coercing mortals into worship or tribute.  

### **Cult Tactics and Rituals**
#### **Blood Oaths**:
These binding pacts are sworn in draconic blood and often enhance a cultist’s strength at the cost of their free will.  
#### **Skyward Invocations**:
Ceremonies performed under celestial alignments that summon manifestations of their dragon’s power—such as fiery rain, shadowy mists, or localized storms.  
#### **Fire-Born Baptisms**:
A rite performed by fire cults where initiates are marked with molten sigils, granting them temporary elemental powers.

## **Conflicts With Other Factions**

Dragon cults often come into direct conflict with religious orders, guilds, and adventuring parties. Their secretive and fanatical nature makes them natural antagonists.

### **The Dawnbringers of Sol vs. the Emberborn Circle**:
The Dawnbringers, who revere the celestial god of light, view the Emberborn as heretics who corrupt the purity of flame. Their skirmishes often involve holy pyromancers battling fire-wielding cultists.  
### **The Celanthari Protectorate vs. the Veilbound Covenant**:
The Celanthari druids believe that the Veilbound’s manipulation of shadow magic desecrates the natural balance of the swamps and forests.  

#### **Draconic Civil Wars**:
Some dragon cults draw the ire of other dragons who oppose their ambitions, leading to violent clashes between draconic factions and their mortal followers.

## **Key Themes Across All Draconic Factions**

### **Balance Of Power**
Dragon cults can act as catalysts for war and upheaval, tipping the scales of power across regions by sowing discord or strengthening weakened kingdoms through draconic alliances.  

### **Mortals And Manipulation**
The complex relationship between dragons and mortals often revolves around manipulation. Cults can be used as pawns, willingly or unwillingly, in draconic schemes.  
\page

### **Ancient Rivalries and Truces**
Many cults carry out the legacies of ancient grudges between dragons, reigniting conflicts that began centuries ago. Some seek to honor ancient truces, while others seek vengeance in their master’s name.

# Dragon Influence and Coexistence

The dragons of Orbis remain a constant presence in humanoid society, whether through subtle manipulation or outright domination. Societies near towers often live under the shadow of draconic oversight, balancing fear and reverence. Dragonborn and tieflings, whose origins are tied to dragons or subparticle influences, frequently find themselves marginalized yet integral to the broader tapestry of Orbis.

Despite conflicts, the comingling of species often leads to unexpected strengths, as diverse talents and traditions blend into something greater than the sum of their parts. This unity, however fragile, may hold the key to challenging Orbis’ balance of power.

## Dragon Society of Orbis

The dragons of Orbis are the undisputed apex predators and rulers of the planet, their presence shaping the evolution of both the environment and humanoid civilizations. They exist as a complex and hierarchical society, tied deeply to the planet and its unique subparticle phenomena. Though dragons are often viewed by humanoids as individualistic or solitary beings, their society operates with intricate rules, traditions, and purposes that extend beyond Orbis itself.

## The Draconic Nursery and Orbis’ Role

Orbis is not just a home to dragons—it is their nursery, a crucial world for the early stages of their lives. The planet’s exotic subparticles make it uniquely suited for young dragons to develop their physical, magical, and intellectual abilities. Each dragon spends its early centuries on Orbis, mastering its domain and learning to navigate the intricate politics and traditions of their species. Only after proving their maturity and capability do they ascend to join the greater interstellar dragon society. This process is central to understanding their motivations and their interactions with the humanoid species.

### Dragon Hierarchies

Draconic society on Orbis is stratified, with roles defined by age, power, and purpose:

#### Wyrmlings

Newly hatched dragons, wyrmlings are vulnerable and remain under the protection of their elder kin. They typically occupy isolated lairs, far from potential humanoid or draconic threats.

Their primary role is to grow and learn, absorbing knowledge of Orbis’ environments and their inherent magical abilities.

#### Young Dragons

Young dragons are tasked with mastering a territory. This stage is a trial of survival and dominance, as they must secure resources, defend their claim, and develop their magical abilities.

Many young dragons become the first draconic beings that humanoids encounter, as they begin to test their influence over lesser creatures.

\page
{{pageNumber,auto}}
#### Adult Dragons

Adult dragons are the architects of Orbis’ draconic society. They establish long-term lairs, accumulate wealth and magical artifacts, and enforce the rules of the draconic hierarchy.

They are also the primary enforcers of the dragons’ unspoken pact to suppress humanoid civilizations that grow too advanced.

#### Ancient Dragons

The most powerful and influential dragons on Orbis, ancient dragons are both guardians of the planet and its greatest manipulators.

They ensure the balance of power remains intact, intervening only when necessary to maintain their dominance or when the planet’s role as a nursery is threatened.

Ancient dragons can also leave Orbis, joining the interstellar society, though some choose to remain, driven by personal or ideological reasons.

### Chromatic and Metallic Dragons

The distinction between chromatic and metallic dragons, as defined in Dungeons & Dragons lore, is integral to understanding the dragons’ varied attitudes and roles on Orbis. This dichotomy provides Dungeon Masters with a framework for interpreting draconic behavior:

#### Chromatic Dragons

Typically associated with greed, malice, and domination, chromatic dragons (e.g., red, blue, black, green, and white) often view humanoids as tools, obstacles, or playthings.

Chromatic dragons are more likely to interfere with civilizations to stoke conflict, sow chaos, or assert their dominance.

Their lairs often reflect their elemental natures, such as fiery volcanoes for red dragons or fetid swamps for black dragons, and their influence can shape entire regions.

#### Metallic Dragons

Generally regarded as noble and altruistic, metallic dragons (e.g., gold, silver, bronze, brass, and copper) are more inclined to guide or protect humanoid civilizations, though their methods vary widely.

Metallic dragons may serve as secret benefactors, offering wisdom or intervention in times of great need. However, their aid is rarely without strings, as even benevolent dragons have their own agendas.

Their lairs often exude an aura of serenity and prosperity, reflecting their alignment and values.

#### Neutral Dragons

Not all dragons fit neatly into the chromatic or metallic dichotomy. Some, such as shadow dragons or gem dragons, follow paths influenced by their unique environments or personal philosophies, creating opportunities for nuanced interactions.

## Geographical Distribution and Interactions

The geography of Orbis and the varied ecosystems created by the subparticle fields determine where specific types of dragons are most commonly found:

**Red Dragons**: Found near volcanic regions such as the plains around the Forge of Embers. Their interactions are often hostile, marked by territorial aggression and dominance over local humanoid settlements.

**Blue Dragons**: Occupying arid deserts near the Shardspire, these dragons manipulate storms and control trade routes through fear and coercion.

**Green Dragons**: Preferring dense forests, green dragons are commonly linked to the Verdant Bastion. Their influence is subtler, often weaving through politics and manipulation of druidic orders.

**Black Dragons**: Dwelling in the swampy deltas around the Veilspire, black dragons thrive on fear and deception, preying on humanoid settlements and maintaining a grip over alchemical resources.

**White Dragons**: Dominating the icy tundras near the Glacial Pillar, these dragons are primal and brutal, often clashing with the hardy Fjornfolk.

**Gold Dragons**: Found near regions of cultural importance, such as the Luminarian Kingdom near the Solspire, these dragons serve as protectors and advisors, though rarely revealing their full power.

**Silver Dragons**: Roaming mountainous regions like those near the Pinnacle, silver dragons are more reclusive but occasionally intervene to protect vulnerable communities.

**Gem Dragons**: Scattered across regions with unique subparticle interactions, such as the Riftspire, gem dragons are enigmatic, often seen as neutral observers or scholars of Orbis’ anomalies.

## Historical Impact on Humanoid Civilizations

Dragons have left an indelible mark on the history of Orbis, shaping the rise and fall of humanoid civilizations:

**The First War**: Early in humanoid history, the elves uncovered evidence of draconic influence, sparking a catastrophic war. Though the elves’ ingenuity allowed them to mount a significant resistance, the dragons’ overwhelming power ultimately shattered their civilization, leading to a long era of suppression.

**The Guiding Hand**: Metallic dragons have quietly influenced humanoid societies, ensuring they remain balanced and prosperous without drawing the ire 
\page
{{pageNumber,auto}}
of their chromatic kin. This guidance has helped create stable regions like the Luminarian Kingdom.
**The Great Razings**: Periodically, chromatic dragons unite to destroy humanoid civilizations that grow too advanced, resetting their progress and reinforcing draconic dominance. These events are etched in legend, often seen as divine punishment by the survivors.

**Cultural Integration**: Over millennia, dragons have become integral to humanoid mythology, inspiring both reverence and terror. Stories of dragonborn, tieflings, and other hybrid species reflect the depth of their interactions with humanoid bloodlines.

## The Game of Influence

Dragons are inherently manipulative and territorial, often engaging in subtle or overt games of influence. Their interactions with humanoid civilizations serve multiple purposes, from entertainment to experimentation. These interactions are guided by a few core principles:

### Testing Civilization:
Dragons frequently push humanoid civilizations to the brink, encouraging their rise while ensuring they do not pose a long-term threat. This involves orchestrating wars, seeding knowledge, or intervening with overwhelming force.

### Breeding and Evolution:
Some dragons manipulate humanoid bloodlines, creating dragonborn or tieflings as part of long-term experiments in loyalty, power, or magical potential.

### Hoarding Knowledge:
Beyond material wealth, dragons hoard knowledge, particularly about the towers and the colonists’ original technology. This information gives them unparalleled control over Orbis’ hidden power.

### Territorial Dominance:
Conflicts between dragons often arise when their spheres of influence overlap, creating opportunities for humanoids to exploit these rivalries.

## Draconic Councils and Alliances

While dragons are inherently solitary creatures, they do form temporary alliances or councils when matters of great importance arise. These councils are rare and often contentious, as dragons’ egos and ambitions clash. Examples include:

### The Council of Balance:
Convened to address significant threats to Orbis’ balance, such as humanoid uprisings or tower activations.

### The Nursery Accord:
An unspoken agreement among dragons to protect Orbis’ role as a nursery, even at the cost of personal ambition.

### Interstellar Delegations:
Ancient dragons returning from the interstellar society occasionally bring new knowledge or directives that shape the future of Orbis.

## Interactions with the Towers

The towers of Orbis are as much a part of draconic intrigue as they are a mystery to humanoids. Dragons understand the towers’ purpose and potential, though they guard this knowledge jealously. Each tower often serves as a focal point of draconic power:

### Guardianship:
Dragons claim towers as part of their territory, using them as lairs or places of experimentation.

### Manipulation:
They exploit the towers’ subparticle fields to enhance their magical abilities or create unique environments.

### Secrecy:
Dragons work to ensure that humanoids never unlock the full potential of the towers, seeing this as a direct threat to their dominance.

## The Interstellar Society

Beyond Orbis, dragons are part of a vast interstellar society that spans countless worlds. This society is governed by principles of dominance, knowledge, and territorial expansion. Orbis’ ancient dragons often leave to join this greater community, where they act as ambassadors, conquerors, or scholars. However, the needs of the nursery tether many dragons to the planet, creating a dynamic where Orbis is both a cradle of power and a proving ground for its mightiest beings.

### Dragons in the Campaign

In the context of a campaign, dragons serve as:

**Antagonists:** 
Powerful enemies whose schemes and strength challenge the party at every level.

**Allies:** Reluctant partners who offer knowledge or aid in exchange for loyalty or treasure.

**Unseen Forces:** Manipulators working behind the scenes, shaping events to test or hinder the adventurers.

**Final Challenges:** The culmination of the party’s journey may involve confronting an ancient dragon or disrupting the balance of power that governs Orbis.

Whether feared, revered, or challenged, the dragons of Orbis are central to the world’s identity, a constant reminder of both its danger and its potential.
