- name: Breath Weapons (Recharge 5-6).
  desc: The dragon uses one of the following breath weapons. - **Acid Breath.** The
    dragon exhales acid in a 20-foot line that is 5 feet wide. Each creature in that
    line must make a DC 11 Dexterity saving throw, taking 18 (`4d8`) acid damage on
    a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.   - **Slowing Breath.**
    The dragon exhales gas in a 15-foot cone. Each creature in that area must succeed
    on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature can't use
    reactions, its speed is halved, and it can't make more than one attack on its
    turn. In addition, the creature can use either an action or a bonus action on
    its turn, but not both. These effects last for 1 minute. The creature can repeat
    the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself
    with a successful save.
