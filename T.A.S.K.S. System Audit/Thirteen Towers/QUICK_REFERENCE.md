## GM Guidelines

### When to Roll
Only if **all three** are true:
1. Outcome is uncertain
2. Failure has consequences
3. Success matters to story

### Making Failure Interesting
Failed rolls should:
- Advance the plot with complications
- Create new challenges
- Never create dead ends

### The 90/10 Rule
- **90%** of play: Medieval fantasy (Game of Thrones)
- **10%** of play: Sci-fi hints (The Matrix)

Keep the science fiction skeleton hidden beneath fantasy flesh.
