# Battle Order System
## Initiative and Turn Order on Orbis

Combat on Orbis uses Position to determine who acts when, creating a dynamic initiative system where preparation and tactics matter more than speed alone.

## Establishing Battle Order

At the start of combat:

1. **Everyone declares intent** (move, strike, protect, cast, command, flee)
2. **GM determines Position** for each character based on:
   - Surprise/preparation
   - Tactical positioning
   - Weapons/readiness
3. **Act in Position order:**
   - **Controlled** acts first (advantage, surprise, preparation)
   - **Risky** acts second (standard engagement)
   - **Desperate** acts last (caught off-guard, outmatched)

Within the same Position, use Reflex to break ties.

## Acting in Battle Order

On your turn:
1. Describe what you're doing
2. GM sets Position and Effect for your action
3. Roll if outcome is uncertain
4. Resolve results

## How Battle Order and Position Interlock

Your **initial Position** (from surprise, preparation) determines when you act.

Your **action's Position** (from what you try to do) determines risk if you fail.

**Example:**
> You have Controlled Position at the start (you ambushed them) — you act first.
> 
> You declare: "I charge into melee to fight three guards at once."
> 
> GM: "That's a Desperate action (outmatched 3-to-1). You act first this round because you started Controlled, but your charge is Desperate Position — if you fail, you're surrounded and take serious harm."

## Changing Your Place on the Ladder

You can improve Position for next round by:
- Taking cover
- Creating distance
- Forcing enemies into bad positioning
- Getting allies to support you

You can worsen Position by:
- Charging recklessly  
- Exposing yourself
- Taking risky gambits

## Units and Formations

For mass battles, collapse groups into units:
- Units have **Morale** instead of individual HP
- Commanders use **Military Power Trees** to shift Position/Effect
- Each roll resolves squad/company/regiment-level conflict

## Quick Reference

```
