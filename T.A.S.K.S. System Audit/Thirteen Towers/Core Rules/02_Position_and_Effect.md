# Position and Effect
## Risk and Reward in Every Roll

Before rolling any dice on Orbis, the table quickly agrees on two crucial aspects: **how dangerous this action is** (Position) and **how much you can achieve** (Effect). These two dials transform the binary success/failure of a d20 roll into meaningful dramatic choices.

---

## What Is Position?

**Position** describes how bad things get if you fail or only partially succeed. It's the answer to: *"What am I risking by attempting this?"*

### **The Three Positions**

| Position | Meaning | Example Consequences on Failure |
|----------|---------|-------------------------------|
| **Controlled** | Relatively safe | Setback, minor cost, lost time, -1 HP |
| **Risky** | Standard danger | Serious problem, harm (Wounded), exposure, -3-5 HP |
| **Desperate** | Severely exposed | Critical harm (Broken), catastrophic loss, escalation, -7+ HP |

Position is determined by:
- **Your approach** (sneaking past vs charging through)
- **The situation** (daylight with cover vs surrounded in darkness)
- **Your preparation** (scouted ahead vs stumbling in blind)
- **Opponent quality** (street thugs vs elite dragon guards)

### **Example: Same Action, Different Positions**

> **Action:** Climbing into the baron's tower to steal documents
>
> **Controlled Position:**
> - You've scouted for weeks
> - You have inside help (a servant left a window unlocked)
> - Guards change shift in 20 minutes (you timed it)
> - **On failure:** You realize the documents aren't there. You retreat safely but wasted the opportunity.
>
> **Risky Position:**
> - You've scouted once, know the basic layout
> - No inside help, but guards seem lazy
> - **On failure:** Guards spot you climbing. You take a Wound escaping and they raise the alarm.
>
> **Desperate Position:**
> - No scouting, going in blind
> - Alert guards after recent assassination attempt
> - Dragon visiting the baron tonight (you don't know this)
> - **On failure:** Caught mid-climb. Guards raise alarm, you fall and break bones (Critical Wound), and the dragon takes personal interest in you.

## What Is Effect?

**Effect** describes how much you accomplish if you succeed. It's the answer to: *"How far does this get me toward my goal?"*

### **The Three Effect Levels**

| Effect | Meaning | Example Outcomes |
|--------|---------|-----------------|
| **Limited** | Small progress | Partial info, temporary advantage, minor dent in obstacle |
| **Standard** | Solid advancement | What you'd normally expect, meaningful progress |
| **Great** | Decisive change | Major breakthrough, overwhelming success, problem solved |

Effect is determined by:
- **Your capabilities** (skill, tools, magic)
- **The scale of the challenge** (picking a lock vs convincing a kingdom)
- **Your leverage** (blackmail material vs empty threats)
- **Opposition quality** (weak guard vs Master Spymaster)

### **Example: Same Action, Different Effects**

> **Action:** Convincing the Merchant Guild to support the alliance
>
> **Limited Effect:**
> - You're an outsider with no reputation
> - You offer vague promises
> - **On success:** They agree to "consider it" and give you a single meeting with mid-level factors.
>
> **Standard Effect:**
> - You're known in trade circles
> - You have evidence of mutual benefit
> - **On success:** The Guild votes to support the alliance provisionally, with conditions.
>
> **Great Effect:**
> - You're a legendary negotiator (Songbearer with Economic Tree nodes)
> - You have ironclad trade agreements and Monument backing
> - You've cultivated relationships with Guild masters for years
> - **On success:** The Guild commits fully, mobilizes resources immediately, and becomes a major alliance pillar.

## How Position and Effect Interact

Position and Effect are **independent but related**. Generally:

- **Better preparation/approach** � Better Position (less risk)
- **More capability/leverage** � Better Effect (more impact)

But you can **trade** between them:

### **Pushing for Effect (Worsening Position)**

You can accept worse Position to increase Effect.

**Example:**
> **Base situation:** Sneaking past guards in Risky Position for Standard Effect
>
> **Player:** "I want to disable all three guards so they can't raise alarm later. I know that's harder."
>
> **GM:** "That increases the Effect to Great, but you'll need to get close to all three  that's Desperate Position. If you fail, they'll surround you."

### **Playing It Safe (Reducing Effect)**

You can accept lower Effect to improve Position.

**Example:**
> **Base situation:** Confronting the corrupt priest in his temple (Risky Position, Standard Effect)
>
> **Player:** "Actually, I just want to plant evidence and leave. I'll confront him later when I have backup."
>
> **GM:** "Smart. That's Controlled Position (safer), but it's only Limited Effect  he won't know you're onto him, but you haven't solved the problem yet."

## Setting Position: GM Guidelines

### **Default Positions for Common Situations**

| Situation | Typical Position | Notes |
|-----------|-----------------|-------|
| **Social persuasion** | Risky | They might reject and remember you tried |
| **Picking a lock (no time pressure)** | Controlled | Takes time, but low consequence |
| **Picking a lock (guards approaching)** | Risky or Desperate | Depends on how close they are |
| **Melee combat** | Risky | Standard exchange of blows |
| **Ambush from hiding** | Controlled | First strike before they respond |
| **Charging into crossbow fire** | Desperate | Exposed and outmatched |
| **Investigating ancient ruins** | Controlled to Risky | Depends on traps, monsters, time |
| **Decoding Chronicle fragment** | Controlled | Mental effort, low physical risk |
| **Negotiating with dragon** | Risky to Desperate | Dragons are dangerous, capricious |

### **Factors That Worsen Position**

- **Time pressure** ("Guards arrive in 2 minutes")
- **Poor tools** ("Improvised lockpicks")
- **Wounds/Strain** ("You're bleeding and exhausted")
- **Surprised/ambushed** ("They were waiting for you")
- **Outmatched** ("It's an Ancient Dragon")
- **Moral friction** ("This violates your oath")

### **Factors That Improve Position**

- **Good preparation** ("You scouted for weeks")
- **Superior tools** ("Monument-tech scanner")
- **Allies** ("Your friend creates a distraction")
- **Surprise** ("You attack from the shadows")
- **Advantage** ("High ground, cover, good lighting")
- **Enemy weakness** ("They're drunk/distracted/wounded")

## Setting Effect: GM Guidelines

### **Default Effects for Common Situations**

| Situation | Typical Effect | Notes |
|-----------|---------------|-------|
| **Average capability vs average obstacle** | Standard | This is the baseline |
| **Weak capability vs strong obstacle** | Limited | Outmatched in skill/resources |
| **Strong capability vs weak obstacle** | Great | You're an expert with good tools |
| **Partial information** | Limited | Asking around vs deep investigation |
| **Grand ambition** | Limited | "Convince entire kingdom" is huge scale |

### **Factors That Reduce Effect**

- **Lack of expertise** ("You've never forged before")
- **Poor tools** ("Rusty blade vs plate armor")
- **Large scale** ("Changing a realm's policy")
- **Strong opposition** ("They're actively defending")
- **Incomplete leverage** ("Threats with no backing")

### **Factors That Increase Effect**

- **High expertise** ("Master Patternweaver with Int 20")
- **Perfect tools** ("Monument fabricator")
- **Focused scope** ("Just this one lock, not the whole heist")
- **Weak opposition** ("Untrained guards")
- **Overwhelming leverage** ("Dragon alliance backing your demand")

## Position and Effect in Combat

Combat uses the same Position/Effect system with specific implications:

### **Combat Position**

| Position | Combat Context | Harm on Failure |
|----------|---------------|-----------------|
| **Controlled** | Cover, reach advantage, surprise | Minor (Bruised, -1 HP) |
| **Risky** | Standard melee exchange | Serious (Wounded, -3-5 HP) |
| **Desperate** | Overextended, surrounded, outmatched | Critical (Broken, -7+ HP, possibly death) |

### **Combat Effect**

| Effect | Combat Result | Example |
|--------|--------------|---------|
| **Limited** | Scratch, shove, pin, morale dent | Minor harm, positioning |
| **Standard** | Solid wound, serious tactical advantage | Wounded enemy, capture |
| **Great** | Decisive blow, finishing move | Broken or dead enemy |

**Example:**
> **Action:** Charging the dragon to protect fleeing civilians
>
> **Position:** Desperate (you're a human facing a dragon)
> **Effect:** Limited (you're buying time, not killing it)
>
> **On success (16+):** You land a solid hit that makes the dragon focus on you instead of the civilians. They escape. But you've enraged it  next exchange will be brutal.
>
> **On failure:** The dragon swats you aside. You take Critical Harm (broken ribs, -8 HP, Serious Wound). The civilians are still in danger.

## Advanced: Negotiating Position and Effect

Position and Effect are **collaborative**. The GM sets them based on the fiction, but players can propose changes by changing their approach.

### **Conversation Flow**

**Player:** "I want to sneak past the guards."

**GM:** "Okay, that's Risky Position (they're alert), Standard Effect (you get past this room)."

**Player:** "Can I improve Position by creating a distraction first?"

**GM:** "Good idea. Make a separate roll to create the distraction (Controlled Position, Limited Effect  you draw their attention briefly). If that succeeds, your sneak attempt becomes Controlled."

### **Player Tools for Influencing Position/Effect**

- **Setup actions:** Take a preliminary step to improve Position or Effect before the main roll
- **Teamwork:** Allies assist, giving better Position or Effect
- **Spending resources:** Use consumables, call in favors, burn Resolve
- **Accepting consequences:** Take Strain, make enemies, sacrifice assets to improve Position/Effect
- **Using specific abilities:** Archetype features, Domain expertise, Tree nodes

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### L **Mistake 1: Everything is Risky/Standard**

Don't default to "Risky Position, Standard Effect" for every roll. Vary them based on fiction.

 **Better:** Let careful players achieve Controlled Position. Let experts achieve Great Effect.

### L **Mistake 2: Position/Effect Don't Match Fiction**

If someone's scouting with Monument tech from a safe distance, don't call it Desperate.

 **Better:** Match Position/Effect to what's actually happening in the story.

### L **Mistake 3: Ignoring Player Negotiation**

Players should be able to change their approach to change Position/Effect.

 **Better:** "How do you want to do this? That approach would be Risky  do you want to try something different?"

### L **Mistake 4: Position Doesn't Matter Because Players Always Succeed**

If players are too competent for the Difficulty, raise the Difficulty  don't ignore Position.

 **Better:** High-competency characters face higher Difficulties, and Position determines *what they risk even when succeeding*.
