# Moral Friction
## The Cost of Compromising Your Principles

---

## What Is Moral Friction?

**Moral Friction** is mechanical resistance when you act against your character's deeply held principles. It manifests as increased Difficulty on actions that compromise who you are.

**Core Principle**: Your beliefs matter. Breaking them should be costly but possible.

---

## How Moral Friction Works

### The Basic Mechanic

When you act against one of your Moral Profile principles:

> **The GM increases the Difficulty by +2 to +6**

The severity depends on how central the principle is to your identity and how severely you're violating it.

### Severity Scale

| Violation Level | Difficulty Increase | Example |
|----------------|-------------------|---------|
| **Minor Bend** | +2 | Shieldbearer allows someone at risk to fend for themselves |
| **Significant Compromise** | +4 | Oathbound breaks a minor oath to achieve a greater good |
| **Core Betrayal** | +6 | Silentknife acts recklessly without a plan |

---

## Moral Profile Principles

Each Archetype has 2-3 core principles (see [[T.A.S.K.S. System Audit/Thirteen Towers/Player Resources/Archetype_Quick_Reference]]). Players may also define 1-2 personal principles during character creation.

### Example Archetype Principles

**Shieldbearer**:
- Never abandon someone you've sworn to protect
- Take the hit meant for others
- Stand when others would flee

**Oathbound**:
- Keep your word, even when inconvenient
- Honor demands honesty in formal agreements
- Your reputation is your bond

**Silentknife**:
- Act from preparation and advantage
- Never waste effort on improvisation when planning works
- Information before action

## GM Guidance: Assessing Friction

### Questions to Ask

1. **Is this a stated principle?** (Check character sheet)
2. **How central is this principle to the character?** (Minor, Significant, Core)
3. **How severe is the violation?** (Bending vs Breaking)

### Decision Tree

```
Is the action against a stated principle?
├─ NO → No Moral Friction
└─ YES → Continue
    │
    How core is this principle to their identity?
    ├─ Minor (background detail) → +2 Difficulty
    ├─ Significant (defines behavior) → +4 Difficulty
    └─ Core (central to who they are) → +6 Difficulty
```

## Examples in Play

### Example 1: Shieldbearer Abandons Post

**Situation**: Kael (Shieldbearer) is guarding a merchant caravan. Raiders attack from one direction. He hears screams from the other end of the convoy but staying at his post protects the merchant who hired him.

**Principle**: "Never abandon someone you've sworn to protect"

**If Kael runs to help the other end**:
- He's abandoning the merchant → **+4 Difficulty** to whatever action he takes
- The principle is Significant (central to being a Shieldbearer)
- It's a direct violation (leaving post = abandoning protection)

**GM**: "You can run to help them, but you're going against everything you stand for. This will be Difficulty 16 (base 12 + 4 Friction) to get there in time."

---

### Example 2: Oathbound Tells White Lie

**Situation**: Sera (Oathbound) is interrogated by city guards looking for her rebel contact. Telling the truth dooms her friend. Lying could save them.

**Principle**: "Honor demands honesty in formal agreements"

**If Sera lies**:
- Guards are authority figures → formal context → **+4 Difficulty**
- Principle is Significant (Oathbound identity)
- But this is survival, not a sworn oath → GM might reduce to +2

**GM**: "You can lie, but it goes against your honor code. Roll Charm + Edge vs Difficulty 14 (base 12 + 2 Friction). Even if you succeed, you'll feel it."

---

### Example 3: Silentknife Acts Without Planning

**Situation**: Tavin (Silentknife) sees an assassination target unexpectedly in the market. No prep, no plan, just an open shot. Window is closing.

**Principle**: "Act from preparation and advantage"

**If Tavin takes the shot**:
- Completely improvised → **+6 Difficulty** (Core identity violation)
- Silentknife's entire approach is "plan first"
- This is the opposite of who they are

**GM**: "You can take the shot, but everything in your training screams not to. Difficulty 18 (base 12 + 6 Friction) to make this work. And even if you hit, you'll have no exit plan."

---

## Player Choice & Consequences

### Why Allow Friction-Breaking Actions?

Moral Friction is **not prohibition** - it's **cost**.

Players should be able to:
- Break their principles when stakes are high enough
- Experience meaningful character development
- Face hard choices between identity and necessity

### What Happens After

**Short Term**:
- The increased Difficulty makes success harder
- Failure is more likely and more costly

**Long Term**:
- Repeated violations may shift the character's Moral Profile
- Other characters notice and react ("I thought you were a protector?")
- Reputation consequences in the fiction

### Changing Principles

If a character consistently violates a principle without regret:
1. The GM should discuss with the player
2. The principle may no longer apply (character evolution)
3. Moral Friction stops applying to that principle
4. But reputation/trust consequences remain

---

## Advanced: Conflicting Principles

### When Two Principles Collide

Sometimes circumstances force you to violate one principle to uphold another.

**Example**: Shieldbearer must choose between protecting one person or another.

**Mechanic**:
- Choose which principle you're upholding
- Apply Friction for the one you're breaking
- The GM may reduce Friction by -2 since you're in an impossible situation

### Multiple Violations

If an action violates multiple principles:
- Use the **highest** Friction value (don't stack)
- Narrative weight increases (this is a massive compromise)
- GM should signal how serious this is

---

## GM Best Practices

### 1. Telegraph Friction Before the Roll

**Always tell the player** before they commit:
- "This goes against your Shieldbearer code. It'll be +4 Difficulty."
- "That's a violation of your oath. You sure you want to proceed?"

### 2. Make It a Meaningful Choice

Don't use Friction to punish:
- Use it to **highlight** character identity
- Use it to **create dramatic tension**
- Use it to **reward adherence** (no Friction = smoother action)

### 3. Adjust for Table Preference

Some groups want harsh Friction (+6 standard), others want gentle (+2 standard). Calibrate to your table.

### 4. Fiction Over Formula

If the violation feels minor in context, reduce Friction. If it feels devastating, increase it. The formula is guidance, not law.

## Quick Reference Table

| Situation | Friction | Why |
|-----------|----------|-----|
| Shieldbearer abandons post | +4 | Significant principle, direct violation |
| Oathbound breaks minor promise | +2 | Minor principle bend |
| Silentknife improvises attack | +6 | Core identity violation |
| Songbearer tells boring truth | +2 | Minor principle bend |
| Patternweaver ignores evidence | +4 | Significant violation of analytical approach |
| Edgerunner plays it safe | +4 | Goes against risk-taking nature |
| Linekeeper abandons tradition | +4 to +6 | Depends on how core the tradition is |

---

## Integration with Other Systems

### Moral Friction + Position/Effect

Moral Friction increases **Difficulty**, not Position.

**Example**:
- Base: Risky Position, Difficulty 12
- With Friction: Risky Position, Difficulty 16 (+4)
- Position stays Risky (consequences same)
- Success just becomes harder to achieve

### Moral Friction + Draconic Attention

Acting against your principles doesn't trigger Draconic Attention by itself. But if the action **also** involves Monument manipulation, oathbreaking with witnesses, or realm-shaking decisions, it might.

The two systems are separate but can combine.

---

## Character Sheet Implementation

Players should list 3-5 principles on their character sheet:

**Principles I Hold** (Acting against these triggers Moral Friction):
1. _______________________________________________
2. _______________________________________________
3. _______________________________________________
4. _______________________________________________
5. _______________________________________________

**Moral Friction Tracker**:
- Mark when you've violated a principle
- Note consequences (narrative, not mechanical)
- Track if principles are evolving

---

## FAQ

**Q: What if my character doesn't have strong principles?**
A: Then Moral Friction rarely applies. Pragmatic characters face fewer internal conflicts but may lack clear identity anchors.

**Q: Can I gain Edge for upholding my principles?**
A: Not automatically. But the GM might grant +1 Edge if upholding a principle makes an action harder but more true to your character.

**Q: What if I disagree with the Friction assessment?**
A: Discuss with the GM. If the principle isn't that important to you, maybe it shouldn't be on your sheet. If it is, the Friction is appropriate.

**Q: Can NPCs have Moral Friction?**
A: Yes! The GM can use it to show NPC character depth. "The knight wants to help you, but her oath prevents it (she'd face +6 Friction to break her vow)."

---

## Design Philosophy

Moral Friction exists to:
1. **Make character identity mechanically relevant**
2. **Create meaningful choices** (easy path vs true path)
3. **Reward consistency** (no Friction when you stay true)
4. **Allow growth** (characters can change, but it should matter)

It is **not** a punishment system. It's a spotlight system that says: "This decision reveals who you are."
