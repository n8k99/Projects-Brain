# Thirteen Towers Gaming System

## Project Overview

Development of a complete tabletop roleplaying game system designed specifically for the Orbis setting. The system uses a narrative-focused, medium-crunch framework built around Position/Effect mechanics, with emphasis on Domain-based progression and consequence-driven gameplay.

## Current Status

**Phase:** Late Alpha / Early Beta
**State:** Conceptually complete, mechanically incomplete
**Priority:** High - Required for full Orbis product suite

## Core Design Pillars

1. **Single Resolution Mechanic:** 1d20 + Stat + Edge vs DC
2. **Position/Effect Framework:** Controls risk vs reward on every action
3. **Domain-Based Progression:** Six domains (Martial, Covert, Magic/Tech, Spiritual, Economic, Political)
4. **Tree System:** Progression through fictional achievement rather than XP
5. **Bounded Mathematics:** Edge capped at ±5, predictable stat ranges
6. **Consequence Variety:** Non-HP consequences drive narrative forward

## Development Priorities

### CRITICAL (Blocks Play)
- Complete character creation procedure (step-by-step)
- 6+ fully-detailed Archetypes with all mechanical effects
- 5-10 example Trees per Domain (30-60 total trees)
- Position/Effect decision matrix with 20+ examples
- Edge calculation worksheet with common scenarios
- Sample encounters with full stat blocks

### HIGH PRIORITY (Needed for Smooth Play)
- Moral Friction formula (clear, unambiguous)
- Draconic Attention trigger list with DC modifiers
- Scale rules (full mechanical treatment)
- Tag library (50+ example tags with effects)
- Equipment list with Edge/effect modifiers
- NPC templates by tier (mook, lieutenant, boss)

### MEDIUM PRIORITY (Polish & Depth)
- Advanced combat rules (zones, formations, mass combat)
- Downtime procedures
- Campaign structure guidance
- Faction rules (mechanical organization handling)
- Monument/relic creation rules

### LOW PRIORITY (Nice to Have)
- Setting gazetteer integration
- Random tables (encounters, complications, NPCs)
- GM advice chapter
- Example campaign arcs

## Key Insights from Analysis

### Strengths
- Narrative-driven design reduces crunch while preserving meaningful choice
- Battle Order → Position innovation creates tactical depth without complexity
- Domain system allows non-combat characters to participate in "combat" meaningfully
- Consequence design (time, resources, position, attention, access, trust) drives story forward
- Bounded math prevents runaway modifiers

### Areas Requiring Refinement
- Position/Effect calibration lacks concrete guidance for GMs
- Edge calculation needs simplification despite consolidation goal
- Tree progression system described but not implemented
- Scale rules mentioned as important but mechanically undefined
- Moral Friction and Draconic Attention formulas contradictory or vague

## AI GM Feasibility

**Assessment:** Highly feasible - system design plays to AI strengths

**AI Advantages:**
- Consistent rule application
- Superior consequence generation
- 24/7 availability
- No rules-lawyering or forgotten modifiers
- Excellent at NPC portrayal and narrative consistency

**AI Challenges:**
- Position/Effect calibration requires training data
- Strategic opposition may be suboptimal
- Long-term plotting needs human structure
- Emotional resonance hit-or-miss

**Recommended Approach:** Hybrid AI/Human system where human sets campaign arc and calibrates difficulty, AI runs individual sessions and handles mechanics.

## Development Timeline Estimates

### Minimum Viable Product
- **Time:** 200-300 hours / 3-4 months part-time
- **Output:** ~150-page rulebook
- **Contents:** Core rules + 3 Archetypes + starter trees + essential examples

### Complete Game
- **Time:** 500-800 hours / 9-12 months part-time
- **Output:** ~250-300 page rulebook
- **Contents:** Full Archetypes, complete trees, advanced rules, extensive examples

### With Playtesting
- **Time:** Add 50% to above estimates
- **Critical for:** Position/Effect calibration, Tree balancing, Edge calculation validation

- Related: [[Orbis|Orbis Overview]] - World overview

## Next Actions

1. **Immediate:** Prioritize CRITICAL development items
2. **Short-term:** Create Quickstart Rules (40-50 pages) with minimal Archetypes/Trees
3. **Medium-term:** Expand based on playtest feedback
4. **Long-term:** Publication-ready version with art and layout

## Notes & Considerations

- System designed to work in Discord with AI GM implementation
- Mechanical framework intentionally mirrors Orbis's thematic tensions (Draconic Attention, Moral Friction)
- Tree system allows characters to shape realm-level events at high tiers
- No separate skill system - specialization through Stats + Archetypes + Domains + Trees + Tags

## Resources Needed

- Playtesting group for calibration
- Art/layout for final publication
- Additional writing support for tree development (60+ trees is substantial)
- AI integration development for Discord bot prototype
