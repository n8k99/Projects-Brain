## Cross-Project Considerations

### Files Needed in Multiple Projects

Some files may be relevant to multiple Projects. Consider uploading to primary Project and referencing in custom instructions:

**Temporal Hierarchy** (needed in both Orbis and Operations):
- Primary: Project 1 (Orbis)
- Reference in: Project 4 custom instructions

**T.A.S.K.S. Architecture** (relevant to both Engineering and Operations):
- Primary: Project 2 (Engineering)
- Reference in: Project 4 custom instructions

**Morning Pages Workflow** (touches both Technical and Content):
- Primary: Project 3 (Content Production)
- Technical docs in: Project 2 (Engineering)

### File Format Considerations

**Markdown Files**: Upload directly
**Canvas Files**: May need to export/screenshot or upload as-is
**JSON/Config Files**: Upload as examples/templates
**Python Files**: Upload documentation about them, not the code itself (reference vault location)

---

## Upload Strategy

### Phase 1: Core Documents (Day 2-3)
Focus on the most essential files for each Project:
- Gaming system core for Orbis
- Architecture docs for T.A.S.K.S.
- Publication workflows for Content
- Registry and TODO for Operations

### Phase 2: Supporting Documentation (Day 3-4)
Add secondary materials:
- Examples and templates
- Workflow documentation
- Historical context

### Phase 3: Reference Materials (Day 4-5)
Complete the collection:
- Additional lore/worldbuilding
- Detailed technical specs
- Persona definitions
- Canvas files

---

## Verification Checklist

Before uploading to each Project, verify:

- All files are accessible in vault
- Files are current/not outdated versions
- No sensitive information (passwords, API keys, personal data)
- File names are clear and descriptive
- Related files are grouped logically
- Custom instructions written for the Project
- Test queries prepared for validation

---

## Next Steps

1. Review each checklist
2. Mark off files as you locate/verify them
3. Organize into folders by Project (optional, for staging)
4. Begin uploads on Day 3 (Dec 14) starting with Project 1
5. Test each Project immediately after uploading

---

*This checklist will evolve as you gather files. Update as needed during Days 2-3.*
