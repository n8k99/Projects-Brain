# Areas Project Conversion

**Project Owner:** [[Eliana]] (Engineering Department)
**Project Status:** Phase 1 - Assessment In Progress
**Priority:** 🔼 Medium - System Improvement
**Start Date:** 2025-11-30
**Target Finish:** 2025-12-15

## Project Overview

Assess the viability of treating notes in the 02 Areas/ directory as formal projects, and if viable, convert them to follow the established projectRegistry system. This includes:
- Creating or updating project specs in Areas/ with descriptive phase goals (no checkboxes)
- Migrating all actionable tasks to TODO.md in T.A.S.K.S. format with consistent tagging
- Establishing wikilinks between projectsRegistry.md and Area-based specs
- Defining tagging conventions for all projects (e.g., #proj-<id>)

**Success Criteria:**
- All existing Area notes either converted to project format or clearly marked as non-projects
- Tasks from Area notes fully integrated into TODO.md without duplication
- Agents can reliably find project details via registry → spec → tasks flow
- Consistent tagging system established for filtering tasks by project

## 📋 Phase 1: Assessment (Current)

**Goal:** Determine if 02 Areas/ notes represent viable projects and catalog their current state.

**Outcomes:**
- Inventory of all notes in 02 Areas/ that appear to be projects (e.g., containing phases, tasks, checkboxes)
- Classification: viable projects vs. supporting/reference materials
- Gap analysis: which Areas lack project structure, which have partial specs
- Recommendation: convert X projects, archive Y notes, create Z new specs

All actionable tasks for this phase live in `TODO.md`, tagged:
- `#proj-areas-conversion-001`
- `#phase-1`

---

## 📋 Phase 2: Conversion Planning (Planned)

**Goal:** Design the exact conversion process and tagging conventions.

**Outcomes:**
- Standard project spec template for Areas/ notes (descriptive only, no checkboxes)
- Tagging convention defined (e.g., #proj-ghost-001, #proj-config-001)
- Migration plan: which tasks move to TODO.md, how to handle completed work
- Wikilink strategy: update projectsRegistry.md to point to Area specs

Tasks: see `TODO.md` with tags `#proj-areas-conversion-001 #phase-2`.

---

## 📋 Phase 3: Pilot Conversion (Planned)

**Goal:** Convert 2-3 representative projects as proof-of-concept.

**Outcomes:**
- Selected projects (e.g., Ghost Tier System, Morning Pages Publishing) fully converted
- Specs rewritten as descriptive phase goals in Areas/
- All tasks migrated to TODO.md with proper tags and IDs
- Wikilinks established in projectsRegistry.md
- Agent test: verify the registry → spec → tasks flow works

Tasks: see `TODO.md` with tags `#proj-areas-conversion-001 #phase-3`.

---

## 📋 Phase 4: Full Conversion (Planned)

**Goal:** Convert all viable projects across 02 Areas/.

**Outcomes:**
- All project-eligible notes in Areas/ follow the new format
- TODO.md contains all project tasks, organized by project tags
- projectsRegistry.md fully wikilinked to Area specs
- Cleanup: archive or reclassify non-project notes

Tasks: see `TODO.md` with tags `#proj-areas-conversion-001 #phase-4`.

---

## 📋 Phase 5: Documentation & Testing (Planned)

**Goal:** Document the new system and test agent compatibility.

**Outcomes:**
- SOP created for future project creation in Areas/
- Agent workflow documented: how to find specs, filter tasks, update status
- System tested: create a new project end-to-end using the new flow
- projectsRegistry.md updated with all active projects

Tasks: see `TODO.md` with tags `#proj-areas-conversion-001 #phase-5`.

---

## 🚧 Blockers & Dependencies

- Access to all 02 Areas/ subdirectories for assessment
- Current TODO.md structure (duplicates need cleaning first)
- Agreement on tagging convention (#proj- vs #ghost-tiers-001 style)
- Wikilink resolution in Obsidian (ensure all links work)
