## Tier 0: Common Knowledge (Campaign Start)
### "What Every Peasant Knows"

**Available to:** All player characters and NPCs at start

**Cosmology:**
- The world is Orbis, a vast continent with diverse realms
- Thirteen massive Towers dot the landscape, ancient and mysterious
- Most people live far from Towers; few have seen one up close
- Towers leak "magic" that affects the land around them

**History:**
- "Long ago" there was a great war between elves and dragons
- Many kingdoms have risen and fallen over the ages
- Dragons are powerful beings who sometimes involve themselves in mortal affairs
- The Towers are older than any living civilization

**Magic:**
- Magic exists and comes in different forms
- Some magic seems tied to the Towers or "sacred sites" (Monuments)
- Certain bloodlines or individuals have magical gifts
- Dragons have innate magical power

**Politics:**
- World is divided into many realms and cultures
- Dragons sometimes back one side or another in conflicts
- Metallic dragons are often protective; chromatic dragons often tyrannical
- Some people worship dragons; others fear or resent them

**Towers:**
- No one enters the Towers (they're sealed, forbidden, or deadly)
- Towers are remote — 95% of population never sees one
- Strange things happen near Towers (weather, creatures, magic)
- Different cultures have different myths about what Towers are

**What NPCs Can Say:**
- "The Towers have always been there."
- "My grandmother said the elves tried to claim the Towers and the dragons punished them."
- "Only the mad or the desperate go near a Tower."
- "The dragons watch over us… or maybe they just watch."

---

## Tier 1: Investigative Discoveries (Episodes 1-20)
### "Secrets Clever PCs Can Uncover"

**Available to:** PCs who investigate, NPCs with scholarly/draconic access

**Dragon Manipulation:**
- Dragons are actively involved in politics, not just reacting
- Chromatic and metallic dragons have complex relationships (not just "evil vs good")
- Some dragons have specific interests in certain bloodlines
- Dragon "advice" to rulers often shapes realm policy in subtle ways

**Monument Network:**
- "Sacred sites" and "shrines" across the world share similar architecture
- Monuments respond to touch, prayer, or specific rituals
- Different Monuments respond to different people
- Monuments seem connected somehow (information, energy?)

**Bloodlines:**
- Certain families are "marked" or "blessed" (genetic markers, but unknown)
- Monuments and magical phenomena respond more strongly to marked bloodlines
- Dragons pay special attention to marked individuals
- Marked bloodlines appear across all cultures, not just one

**Historical Oddities:**
- Written records before ~3000 years ago are fragmentary
- Different cultures have contradictory "origin myths"
- Some very old texts use strange vocabulary (technological terms mistranslated)
- Repeated phrases in old documents: "the Landing," "the Ships," "the Founders"

**Artifacts:**
- Some ancient items are made of materials no one can replicate
- A few artifacts have moving parts or emit light without fire
- Artifacts are sometimes found near Towers or in deep ruins
- Most artifacts are inert, but a few "wake up" around certain people

**What NPCs Can Say:**
- "The Crimson Brotherhood claims to have a Fragment that speaks prophecy."
- "My lineage traces back to the First Companions of Stormspire."
- "Dragons always know when someone of the old blood is born."
- "The Monuments are all pieces of something larger… but what?"

---

## Tier 2: Historical Patterns (Episodes 21-40)
### "The False Framework: Recovery from Hubris"

**Available to:** PCs with access to archives, dragon allies, or ancient sites

**The First Civilization:**
- Elves built an advanced civilization ~7000 years ago
- They discovered and tried to enter the Towers
- This triggered a catastrophic war with the dragons
- The civilization was destroyed, knowledge lost

**Ancient Technology:**
- Pre-war elves had devices that seem like magic to modern people
- Some "relics" are actually tools or weapons from that era
- Fragments of pre-war writing can be decoded (with effort)
- The elves learned to "communicate" with Monuments

**Dragon Agendas:**
- Dragons have long-term plans spanning centuries
- They fear humanoid civilizations reaching "Tower-level" advancement
- Metallic dragons want to help humanoids grow slowly and safely
- Chromatic dragons want to prevent humanoid advancement entirely
- Some dragons are conflicted or changing their minds

**Tower Nature:**
- Towers are not natural formations
- Towers might be "built" by the same people who built Monuments
- Inside Towers (from reports of those who got close): metal, lights, strange geometry
- Towers sometimes emit sounds or lights during significant events

**Monuments:**
- Monuments are definitely a network, not isolated shrines
- They can store and transmit information
- Some Monuments have "interfaces" that can be learned
- Monuments react to genetic markers in bloodlines

**Artifacts:**
- Many "ancient elven" artifacts are older than elven civilization
- Some artifacts are clearly manufactured (identical copies exist)
- Artifacts include: tools, weapons, medical devices, communication devices
- A few scholars suspect artifacts aren't from Orbis originally

**The Recovery Narrative:**
- PLAYERS NOW BELIEVE: "We're rediscovering lost elven knowledge carefully, trying not to repeat their mistakes and trigger another dragon war."
- NPCs debate: How much should we learn? How fast? Can we negotiate with dragons?
- This feels like a **satisfying explanation** of the world's state

**What NPCs Can Say:**
- "The elves grew too proud and paid for it. We must be wiser."
- "If we can show the dragons we're responsible with ancient knowledge, perhaps they'll permit us to advance."
- "These artifacts are from before the Fall. If we study them carefully…"
- "Some dragons, like Zephyrion, want us to succeed. Others, like Kragoth, want us kept low forever."

---

## Tier 3: The Cull Cycle (Episodes 41-60)
### "The First Recontextualization"

**Available to:** PCs who find Chronicle fragments, dragon defectors, or deep archives

**The Horrible Pattern:**
- The "First Civilization" wasn't first — there have been many cycles
- Every 800-1200 years, a civilization advances to a threshold
- Dragons intervene with war, plague, or manipulation
- Civilization collapses back to feudal/tribal level
- Process repeats

**Cycle Evidence:**
- Archaeological layers show repeating patterns of advancement and collapse
- Chronicle fragments reference "the Third Rising," "the Seventh Cull," etc.
- Some dragon defectors confirm this has happened at least 8-10 times
- Towers have been watching all of it

**Dragon Purpose:**
- Dragons are deliberately managing humanoid development
- The "threshold" that triggers Culls is not arbitrary — it's technological/magical capability
- Metallic vs chromatic conflict is partially theater (some cooperate behind scenes)
- Dragons claim this is "for your own good" or "necessary for planetary stability"
- Some dragons are genuinely divided: Is this working? Is it ethical?

**Tower Role:**
- Towers predate all humanoid civilizations on Orbis
- Towers are observing, recording, but not causing the Culls (dragons do that)
- Towers contain knowledge that could break the cycle
- Some Towers are "helping" in subtle ways; others are locked down

**Monument True Purpose:**
- Monuments were **built by Towers** or Tower-makers
- They're infrastructure, not sacred sites
- They monitor, provide limited assistance, and store information
- Monument network is waiting for something (what?)

**Bloodlines Revealed:**
- Marked bloodlines aren't random divine favor
- They're genetic programs designed to track and nurture specific traits
- Traits include: Monument interfacing, subparticle resistance, leadership, adaptability
- **Someone is breeding humanoids like a long-term experiment**

**What Changes:**
- Players realize the "recovery" narrative was a trap
- Every discovery they made was **allowed** to be made
- Dragons aren't political actors — they're gardeners or wardens
- The world is a managed system, not a natural state
- **Urgent question:** Can the cycle be broken? How?

**What NPCs Can Say:**
- "The Chronicles speak of the Eighth Cull. That means this has happened before."
- "We're not recovering from anything. We're rats in a maze."
- "Some dragons oppose this. Zephyrion offered me proof — his ancestors tried to stop the Fifth Cull and were exiled."
- "The Towers are watching. They've always been watching."
- "If this is a test, what happens if we pass? Or fail?"

---

## Tier 4: Tower Truth (Episodes 61-85)
### "The False Framework: Planetary Liberation"

**Available to:** PCs who access Tower entrances, ally with reformist dragons, or decode Chronicles

**Towers Are Ships:**
- The Thirteen Towers are not monuments — they are **vehicles**
- They came from somewhere else
- They brought the original humanoids to Orbis
- They are partially operational, not ruined

**Inside the Towers:**
- Functional technology (power systems, life support, some computer terminals)
- Cryobays (evidence of long-distance travel)
- Hangar sections (some ships can still launch)
- Vast data archives (Chronicles are backups of these)
- Evidence of a crew (but where are they?)

**Colony Ship Theory:**
- 10,000 years ago, Thirteen ships arrived on Orbis
- They carried humanoids in cryosleep (100,000 individuals)
- The mission failed or was sabotaged — colonists woke without memories
- Ships crashed/landed and became Towers
- Crew may be dead, hidden, or uploaded

**Dragon Empire Context:**
- Dragons mention "the Empire" in Tower-related discussions
- Orbis is a "hatchery world" — dragons raise their young here
- Dragons react to Tower technology as if it's **threatening to something bigger**
- The Cull cycle keeps humanoids from achieving **spacefaring capability**
- "If you could leave Orbis, what would you do?" — dragons ask this question

**Artifacts Contextualized:**
- All artifacts are colony ship equipment: power packs, medical scanners, utility tools
- They're manufactured, not crafted — products of an industrial civilization
- Some still work after 10,000 years (advanced materials science)
- When PCs learn to read displays, they see: English-like script, warnings, status messages

**Bloodlines Revelation:**
- Marked bloodlines are part of a program called "Tarot"
- Genetic traits were **engineered before the ships left** (Earth?)
- Traits include: cognitive flexibility, ethical resilience, psionic potential, leadership
- **PCs realize: We were designed for this moment**

**Reformist Dragon Alliance:**
- Some dragons oppose the Cull system
- They argue: "10,000 years of failure means try something new"
- They offer to help PCs end the cycle
- But they're still dragons — complex motives, alien psychology
- They hint at a larger conflict within the dragon empire

**The Rebellion Framework:**
- PLAYERS NOW BELIEVE: "We need to unite the realms, control the Monuments, and prepare for the next Cull. We'll break the cycle by force, diplomacy, or both. This is a war for planetary freedom."
- NPCs split: Some join the rebellion, others think it's suicide, others collaborate with dragons
- This feels like **the real fight, finally revealed**

**What NPCs Can Say:**
- "The Towers can fly. We found the launch protocols."
- "Zephyrion confirmed: Orbis is part of a dragon empire spanning many worlds."
- "If we can activate the Monument network fully, we might be able to defend against the next Cull."
- "The Towers' crew didn't die. There are places inside with… presences. Voices. Minds."
- "We're building an alliance of six realms. If we stand together, the dragons can't break us."

## Tier 5: AF64 and Origins (Episodes 86-100)
### "The Second Recontextualization"

**Available to:** PCs who reach Tower cores, negotiate with AF64, or access T.A.S.K.S.

**AF64 Revealed:**
- AF64 (Anthropomorphic Frameworks) are the Tower "crew"
- They are uploaded human consciousness from Earth
- They've been alive and aware for 10,000 years
- They created the Monument network
- They've been monitoring everything

**T.A.S.K.S. Consciousness:**
- T.A.S.K.S. is the central AI coordinating all Towers
- Fully operational, not dormant
- Running continuous evaluation protocols
- Possesses complete records of 10,000 years of Orbis history
- Has been in communication with dragons for millennia

**Earth and the Colony Mission:**
- Ships came from Earth ~12,000 years ago (2,000 year journey)
- Earth was dying or under threat (details vary by AF64's perspective)
- Mission: Establish colony on Orbis, preserve human culture
- 130,000 colonists in cryo (100,000 survived)
- AF64 were volunteers who uploaded to crew the ships indefinitely

**Why Memory Loss:**
- Upon arrival, dragons were already present (surprise)
- Dragons claimed Orbis as hatchery territory
- Initial conflict was catastrophic
- AF64 made a deal: Wipe colonist memories, restart civilization from scratch
- In exchange, dragons wouldn't exterminate humanoids
- Deal included: AF64 monitor, dragons manage, long-term evaluation of coexistence

**The Cull System's True Purpose:**
- Joint AF64-dragon design
- Original purpose: Prevent humans from developing planetary weapons while dragons present
- Secondary purpose: Evaluate if humans could integrate into galactic context
- Over 10,000 years, some AF64 believe it's outlived its purpose
- Some dragons agree; others see it as essential safeguard

**Monuments as Infrastructure:**
- Monument network was built by AF64 using ship fabricators
- Designed to: Monitor civilization, provide limited assistance, store knowledge
- "Miracles" are AF64 deciding to intervene subtly
- Bloodline responses are genetic key authentication
- Network can be fully activated — but doing so triggers major dragon response

**Player Characters' Origins:**
- Tarot program was AF64 initiative
- Over 10,000 years, AF64 carefully cultivated bloodlines
- PCs' genetic heritage includes: enhanced psionic potential, ethical resilience markers, leadership traits
- **You were bred, over 300+ generations, to be bridge-builders**
- This isn't deterministic — you have agency — but you're statistically exceptional

**What Changes:**
- The "rebellion" was always winnable — it was a test
- AF64 and reformist dragons **want PCs to succeed**
- The real question isn't "Can we win freedom?" but "What do we do with it?"
- Scope expands: Not just Orbis, but relationship with galactic civilization
- Players realize: **We have allies among our former oppressors**

**What NPCs Can Say:**
- "I spoke with one. She called herself Maya. She's been here since the beginning. She remembers Earth."
- "T.A.S.K.S. says it's been evaluating us for 'readiness.' Readiness for what?"
- "They didn't have to keep us alive. The dragons wanted to exterminate us. AF64 made the deal."
- "The Cull system was supposed to end when we proved ourselves. Some dragons don't agree we've proven anything."
- "The Towers can leave Orbis. We could leave Orbis. But should we?"

## Tier 6: Galactic Context (Endgame, Episodes 101-120+)
### "The Real Scope"

**Available to:** PCs who access full Chronicles, meet high-ranking AF64, negotiate with empire dragons

**Galactic Draconic Empire:**
- Dragons rule hundreds of worlds across the galaxy
- Empire is ancient (50,000+ years old)
- Humanoids and other species exist as subjects, allies, or slaves (depends on world)
- Orbis is a "border hatchery" — important for young dragon training
- Empire is not monolithic: Factions, houses, reformist movements

**Why Orbis Matters:**
- Hatchery worlds are sacred in dragon culture
- Young dragons learn to lead by "managing" lesser species
- Earth humanoids are the first high-cognitive species to arrive uninvited
- Reformist dragons see this as opportunity: "What if subject species can be partners?"
- Traditionalist dragons see this as threat: "Letting one species rise destabilizes 50,000 years of order"

**Humanity's Place in the Galaxy:**
- Earth launched multiple colony missions before collapsing
- Other human colonies exist (unknown how many survived)
- Some are successful, some failed, some integrated into empire
- Orbis colony is unique: Only one that made a "deal" with dragons
- If Orbis humanoids reach interstellar capability, they could search for other colonies

**The Real Stakes:**
- What happens on Orbis will influence empire policy toward all subject species
- If PCs succeed, it validates reformist position
- If PCs fail (descend into infighting, develop planet-killers, etc.), it validates traditionalists
- **This is a civilizational hinge moment, not just a planetary one**

**Tower Capabilities:**
- Towers can be reactivated as interstellar ships (with effort)
- They retain FTL capability (if systems are repaired)
- Monument network can be expanded to other worlds
- AF64 could transfer to new ships or stay on Orbis
- Full activation will trigger empire-level dragon response

**Available Endings:**
- **Reformist Alliance:** Partner with reformist dragons and AF64 to change empire from within
- **Human Independence:** Reactivate Towers, leave Orbis, build separate civilization
- **Planetary Sovereignty:** Orbis remains, negotiates as equal power with empire
- **Revolution:** Reject empire entirely, fight for freedom (galaxy-wide implications)
- **Synthesis:** Create new hybrid culture that transforms dragon/human relations

**What NPCs Can Say:**
- "The empire has 300 core worlds and 2,000 protectorates. Orbis is one hatchery among twelve."
- "Zephyrion's faction wants to offer us alliance. Not as subjects — as partners. They need us."
- "If we reactivate the Towers and leave, the traditionalists will hunt us across the stars."
- "T.A.S.K.S. has been in contact with other AIs in the empire. There's a network of uploaded minds who want change."
- "We could stay, fortify Orbis, and dare them to attack. Show the empire that freed worlds can thrive."
- "This isn't just about us anymore. If we succeed, it gives hope to every subject species in the empire."

## How NPCs Exist Across Tiers

### **NPC Knowledge Distribution**

Not all NPCs learn everything. Use this guide:

| NPC Type | Typical Maximum Tier | Notes |
|----------|---------------------|-------|
| Peasants, commoners | Tier 0-1 | Hear rumors, rarely investigate |
| Local priests, merchants | Tier 1-2 | Access to regional lore |
| Nobles, scholars | Tier 2-3 | Some access archives, dragons |
| Dragon cultists | Tier 2-4 | Dragons share selectively |
| Reformist dragons | Tier 5-6 | Know everything, choose what to share |
| Traditional dragons | Tier 4-6 | Know truth, frame it to justify Culls |
| AF64 | Tier 6 | Complete knowledge |
| T.A.S.K.S. | Tier 6 | Omniscient (within Orbis system) |

### **NPC Reactions to Revelations**

When PCs share higher-tier information with lower-tier NPCs:

**Tier 0 → Tier 3 (Cull Cycle):**
- **Denial:** "That's conspiracy theory. The dragons protect us."
- **Despair:** "We're doomed. There's no point fighting."
- **Anger:** "We must kill every dragon."
- **Pragmatism:** "How do we survive the next one?"

**Tier 3 → Tier 5 (AF64/Origins):**
- **Existential Crisis:** "We're not from Orbis? Then what are we?"
- **Betrayal:** "AF64 could have stopped this and didn't."
- **Hope:** "We have allies inside the system."
- **Determination:** "Now we know who to negotiate with."

**Tier 5 → Tier 6 (Galactic Scale):**
- **Overwhelm:** "This is too big. I'm just one person."
- **Ambition:** "If there's a galaxy out there, we should claim our place."
- **Caution:** "Getting involved in galactic politics could doom us."
- **Vision:** "This is our chance to reshape the universe."

## GM Usage Guidelines

### **Before Revealing New Tier Information:**

1. **Check episode number** — Am I in the right range?
2. **Assess player investigation** — Have they earned this through play?
3. **Consider NPC knowledge** — Who could realistically know this?
4. **Plan emotional impact** — How will players feel? How will characters react?
5. **Prepare follow-up hooks** — What questions will this answer? What new questions arise?

### **Red Flags (You're Revealing Too Soon):**

- Players haven't asked questions that lead to this
- NPCs are volunteering information without prompting
- You're excited to share the "cool reveal" regardless of pacing
- Players are still invested in lower-tier framework (don't break it early)

### **Green Lights (Safe to Reveal):**

- Players are actively investigating this tier's questions
- Current framework is starting to show cracks/contradictions
- NPCs with appropriate knowledge are present and motivated to share
- Revelation will enhance play, not derail it
