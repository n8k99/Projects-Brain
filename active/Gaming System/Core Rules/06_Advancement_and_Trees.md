# Advancement and Trees
## Character Progression on Orbis

Characters on Orbis advance through **Domain Trees** — progression paths that represent deepening expertise in one of five power domains. Unlike traditional class levels, Trees are unlocked through **fictional advancement triggers**: NPC relationships, story events, and meaningful choices.

## The Five Domains

1. **Martial** – Force of bodies, combat, command
2. **Covert** – Force of information, intelligence, networks
3. **Economic** – Force of value, logistics, trade
4. **Spiritual** – Force of belief, ritual, community
5. **Magic/Tech** – Force of mechanisms, Monuments, subparticles

## Domain Tree Development Priorities

**This system emphasizes investigation and coordination over combat:**

- **Covert**: 30-40% development (PRIMARY FOCUS)
- **Political/Spiritual**: 25-30% development  
- **Magic/Tech**: 15-20% development
- **Economic**: 10-15% development
- **Martial**: 5-10% development (minimal, functional)

**Combat exists but is NOT the focus.** Investigation, intelligence gathering, and coordination are the primary modes of play.

## How Trees Work

Each Tree contains **nodes** (abilities/capabilities) arranged in tiers:

- **Novice** (Entry-level)
- **Journeyman** (Competent)
- **Adept** (Skilled)
- **Expert** (Masterful)
- **Master** (Legendary)
- **Apex** (World-changing)

### Node Structure

Each node has:

1. **Name and Tier**
2. **Advancement Trigger** (fictional requirement — what must happen in the story)
3. **Mechanical Effect** (what it does in gameplay)
4. **Multiple Act Interpretations** (how it reads differently in Acts 2, 4, and 5)

**Example Node:**

**Strategic Intelligence Coordinator** (Expert tier, Covert Domain)

**Advancement Trigger:** Successfully coordinate intelligence gathering across three realms simultaneously, earning trust of at least two regional spymasters

**Mechanical Effect:** +2 Edge when directing multi-source intelligence operations. Can establish information-sharing protocols between previously uncooperative factions.

**Act Interpretations:**
- **Act 2 frame:** "Coordinate recovery of lost knowledge across cultures"
- **Act 4 frame:** "Coordinate rebellion intelligence networks"
- **Act 5 reality:** "Coordinate fleet intelligence operations"

## Advancement Triggers, Not XP Grinding

You don't "gain XP and level up." You advance by **doing things in the story:**

**Bad advancement:** "Kill 10 orcs to unlock Weapon Specialist"

**Good advancement:** "Train with the weapon master NPC for three sessions, prove yourself in a duel, and commit to their martial philosophy"

### Types of Advancement Triggers

- **NPC Relationships:** "Gain the trust of Master Smith Thorgrim"
- **Story Events:** "Survive the Cull revelation without breaking"
- **Institutional Ties:** "Be appointed Factor for the Merchant Guild"
- **Knowledge Discovery:** "Decode a complete Chronicle fragment"
- **Moral Choices:** "Uphold your oath even when it costs you dearly"
- **Infrastructure Building:** "Establish a safehouse network across two cities"

## Archetypes Are NOT Classes

**Remember:** Archetypes (Shieldbearer, Songbearer, etc.) are **moral and ethical frameworks**, NOT combat roles.

**Any character can acquire any Domain Tree node** provided they:
1. Have the NPC relationship or story prerequisite
2. Make choices aligned with that domain
3. Invest time in the fiction

A Songbearer can develop Covert intelligence nodes. A Shieldbearer can become an Economic factor. Archetypes color HOW you approach domains, not which domains you can access.

## Trees by Domain (Examples)

### Covert Domain (30-40% Development - PRIMARY)

**Intelligence Networks Tree:**
- Street Ears (Novice) → Local Network Handler (Journeyman) → Master of Levers (Apex)

**Investigation Techniques Tree:**
- Pattern Observer → Evidence Analyst → Truth Seeker

**Infiltration Tree:**
- Shadow Walker → Identity Crafter → Ghost in the Court

**Counter-Intelligence Tree:**
- Spy Catcher → Network Breaker → Counterspy Master

**Information Warfare Tree:**
- Rumor Weaver → Narrative Controller → Information Architect

### Political Domain (25-30% Development)

**Faction Navigation, Diplomacy, Alliance Building, Authority and Legitimacy, Treaty Crafting**

### Spiritual Domain (20-25% Development)

**Lore Understanding, Metaphysical Investigation, Belief Systems, Pattern Recognition**

### Magic/Tech Domain (15-20% Development)

**Monument Research, Tower Functions, Chronicle Decipherment, Artifact Analysis**

### Economic Domain (10-15% Development)

**Resource Intelligence, Supply Networks, Coordination Logistics**

### Martial Domain (5-10% Development - Minimal)

**See [[Domain Trees/Martial/Martial]] — adequate as-is, not primary focus**

## When You Advance

When you complete an advancement trigger:
1. Mark the node as acquired
2. Gain its mechanical benefit (Edge bonuses, new capabilities)
3. Update your character concept with this expertise
4. Consider: What new story hooks does this create?

## Multiple Trees

You can develop nodes in **multiple Trees** across **multiple Domains**. Most characters will have:

- **One primary Tree** (4-6 nodes, from Novice to Expert/Master)
- **2-3 secondary Trees** (2-4 nodes each, complementary skills)
- **Occasional dips** (1-2 nodes in other useful areas)

**Example Character (Episode 60):**

- **Covert/Intelligence Networks**: 6 nodes (Novice → Master)
- **Political/Diplomacy**: 3 nodes (Novice → Adept)
- **Spiritual/Lore Understanding**: 2 nodes (Novice → Journeyman)
- **Economic/Resource Intelligence**: 2 nodes (Novice → Journeyman)
