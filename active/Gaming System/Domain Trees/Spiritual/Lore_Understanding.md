# Lore Understanding Tree
## Mastery of Myths, Legends, and Sacred Narratives

This tree represents your ability to understand, preserve, and interpret cultural narratives, myths, and lore. Lore Understanding specialists are keepers of stories—they know what people believe about the past, can distinguish myth from history, and understand how narratives shape culture. In a world recovering from the Shattering, those who understand what was lost (and what was changed) hold profound power.

**Fictional Scale:** Story Collector → Loremaster → Keeper of Forgotten Truths

- At least one Expert-tier feature from any third domain

### Features:

#### Complete Narrative Heritage
**Mechanical Effect:** You hold civilization's complete mythological heritage in your mind and archives. You have +4 Edge on all lore.

You know:

You are the authority on human narrative heritage. When questions arise about cultural narratives, you are the final reference.

**Act Interpretations:**

#### Narrative Architecture
**Mechanical Effect:** You understand how narratives shape civilizations:

- What narratives enable resistance vs. submission
- How to craft stories that shape society

You can:
- Design narratives that achieve specific cultural effects

## APEX DISCOVERY

**At Living Chronicle tier, characters realize:**

You've collected all the stories, traced all the myths, understood all the narratives. You know how cultures transmit meaning across generations.

And then you notice: certain narratives persist *too* consistently. Myths about Dragon benevolence appear in unconnected cultures. Stories that glorify submission to authority emerge independently. Narratives that channel resistance into symbolic rather than material action spread unusually well.

The horrible question: Are some myths *designed*? Do Dragons permit certain narratives because they serve the Cull cycle? When you preserve and spread stories, are you transmitting genuine cultural heritage—or are you unknowingly propagating control narratives?

You're the keeper of stories. But some stories might be cages disguised as culture.

**GM Note:** This is the realization that mythological systems might be partially engineered—that Dragons allow certain narratives to flourish because they create cultural patterns that support the Cull cycle. The Living Chronicle knows all human stories, but must question which stories are genuinely human vs. subtly designed. The revelation should emerge gradually through play, not as a single moment.
