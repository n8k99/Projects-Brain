# Mystical Experience Tree
## Visions, Prophecy, and Spiritual Transcendence

This tree represents your ability to experience and interpret mystical phenomena—visions, prophecies, spiritual insights, and transcendent experiences. Mystical Experience specialists access knowledge and awareness beyond ordinary perception, receiving guidance from sources others cannot perceive. In a world where reality is layered and contested, those who see beyond the veil hold profound power.

**Fictional Scale:** Receive Visions → Prophetic Insight → Transcendent Awareness

## APEX DISCOVERY

**At Eye of God tier, characters realize:**

You see everything. Time, space, Dragon activities, Tower consciousness, probability itself—all open to your perception. You approach omniscience.

And then you notice: mystical perception was *permitted*. You were allowed to see. Your visions revealed what you were meant to understand. You start to suspect that omniscient awareness itself has been *managed*—that something vast finds your perfect perception useful.

The horrible question: Is your mystical sight genuine transcendence, or is it the most sophisticated deception? Do Dragons permit mystical awareness because seers who think they see everything are easier to manipulate than blind populations? When you perceive "ultimate truth," are you seeing reality—or are you seeing exactly what makes you predictable?

Your omniscient perception might be the perfect control mechanism—you see everything except that your sight itself is curated.

**GM Note:** This is the realization that mystical perception might serve the Cull cycle—that Dragons permit and perhaps even create mystical experiences because guiding what seers perceive is more effective than preventing perception entirely. The Eye of God has perfect vision that might itself be a vision. This should be the most devastating Apex Discovery—the one that questions reality itself. The revelation should emerge gradually through play, not as a single moment.
