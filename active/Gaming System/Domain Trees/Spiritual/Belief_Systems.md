# Belief Systems Tree
## Understanding and Shaping What People Believe

This tree represents your ability to understand, interpret, and shape belief systems. Belief Systems specialists engineer faith—they determine what populations believe about Dragons, Towers, the divine, and their place in the cosmos. On Orbis, where the "divine" is demonstrably real but interpretation is contested, belief engineering is profound power.

**Fictional Scale:** Local Priest → Theologian → Prophet → Faith Founder

**Prerequisites:**
- Theological Insight (Spiritual: Belief Systems)
- At least one feature from Political domain OR Covert domain

- Inspiring religious fervor
- Challenging existing orthodoxy

When you preach to a group, you can:

**Prerequisites:**

- At least one feature from Spiritual: Lore Understanding
- At least one feature from Political: Authority & Legitimacy

You can:
- Declare what is orthodox vs. heretical
- Interpret scripture authoritatively
- Settle theological disputes with binding rulings

## The Revelator (Apex Tier)

**Advancement Trigger:** Your revelation reshapes civilizational belief about fundamental questions—Who are the Dragons? What are the Towers? What is humanity's purpose?

**Prerequisites:**
- Scriptural Authority (Spiritual: Belief Systems)
- At least one Master-tier feature from Political domain
- At least one Master-tier feature from Spiritual: Lore Understanding OR Magic/Tech: Monument Research
- At least one Expert-tier feature from any third domain

### Features:

#### Civilizational Revelation
**Mechanical Effect:** Your theology transforms how civilization understands reality. You've provided answers to the fundamental questions:
- The nature of Dragons (divine? alien? artificial?)
- The purpose of Towers (sacred? technological? prisons?)
- The meaning of the Cull (divine plan? exploitation? system malfunction?)
- Humanity's place in the cosmos (chosen? enslaved? autonomous?)

Your revelation:
- Spreads across realms and cultures
- Fundamentally shifts how populations behave
- Creates new categories of thought
- Becomes THE framework through which people understand their world

Future ages measure time from your revelation. "Before the Revelation" and "After the Revelation" become historical periods.

**Act Interpretations:**
- Act 2: "Revealing Towers as ships, Dragons as AI"
- Act 4: "Proclaiming the Cull as genocide, not divine plan"
- Act 5: "Establishing human autonomy as sacred truth"

#### Faith Tradition Immortality
**Mechanical Effect:** Your faith tradition outlives empires and endures for generations:
- Your teachings are studied centuries after your death
- Your institutions span continents and survive political upheaval
- Your faith shapes laws, customs, and culture
- Future religious movements reference or react to your revelation

You've created something that cannot be destroyed by force—it lives in hearts and minds.

Once per campaign, you can invoke your civilizational authority:
- Spend 5 Stress to have your religious movement support or oppose a major political development
- Mobilize millions of believers toward a specific goal
- Provide theological justification that reshapes political legitimacy

#### The Dangerous Answer
**Mechanical Effect:** Your revelation has answered the big questions—and some of those answers are dangerous to the established order. When you proclaim truths about Dragons, Towers, or the Cull:
- You can shatter existing theological frameworks
- You can delegitimize Dragon authority through theology
- You can reframe the Cull as atrocity rather than divine mystery
- You can inspire civilizational resistance through religious conviction

This is extremely dangerous. Dragons will notice. AF64 will evaluate. But once your revelation spreads, it cannot be recalled.

Your theology might end the Cull—or might trigger your own martyrdom.

## APEX DISCOVERY

**At The Revelator tier, characters begin to notice:**

Your religious movement succeeds *too* well. Conversions happen smoothly. Persecution creates martyrs who strengthen the faith. Your theology spreads faster than natural communication should allow. You start to suspect your revelation has been *permitted* to spread—that something vast finds your faith useful.

The horrible question: Have you created genuine liberation theology, or have you built a new control mechanism? Do Dragons allow religious movements because they channel revolutionary energy into controllable spiritual frameworks rather than material resistance?

When millions follow your teachings, are they free—or have you created a more efficient cage?

**GM Note:** This is the realization that religious movements might be permitted by Dragons as pressure release valves—spiritual rebellion instead of material revolution. The Revelator has created genuine meaning and community, but may have also made resistance "safe" by redirecting it into theological rather than practical action. The revelation should emerge gradually through play, not as a single moment.
