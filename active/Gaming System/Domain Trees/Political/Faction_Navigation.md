# Faction Navigation Tree
## Understanding and Maneuvering Between Competing Interests

This tree represents your ability to understand factional politics, navigate competing interests, and maneuver between power blocs without getting destroyed. Faction Navigation specialists thrive in complex political environments, turning conflicts into opportunities and building power through strategic positioning. In fractured political landscapes, those who can navigate factions become indispensable brokers.

## APEX DISCOVERY

**At Shadow Parliament tier, characters realize:**

You broker all major factional politics. All significant factions operate through your frameworks. You've created stable multi-faction governance that prevents civil war and enables coordination.

And then you notice: factional politics work *too* smoothly. Conflicts resolve *too* neatly. Factions accept your mediation *too* readily. You start to suspect factional politics itself has been *permitted* to exist—that something vast finds managed factional competition useful.

The horrible question: Have you created genuine democratic pluralism, or have you built a sophisticated control mechanism? Do Dragons allow factional politics because competing factions are easier to manage than unified resistance? When you broker factional balance, are you preserving freedom—or maintaining controlled opposition?

Your shadow parliament might be the most sophisticated cage ever built—and you're the architect.

**GM Note:** This is the realization that factional politics might serve the Cull cycle—that Dragons permit and even encourage managed factional competition because it channels political energy into controllable forms rather than unified revolutionary action. The Shadow Parliament has perfected factional governance, which makes it extraordinarily effective at managing human politics but potentially harmless to Dragon power. The revelation should emerge gradually through play, not as a single moment.
