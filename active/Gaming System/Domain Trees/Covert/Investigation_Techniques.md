# Investigation Techniques Tree
## Uncovering Hidden Truths Through Analysis and Deduction

This tree represents your ability to investigate mysteries, analyze evidence, and deduce hidden truths. Investigation Techniques specialists solve crimes, unravel conspiracies, and decode ancient mysteries through systematic analysis and pattern recognition. In a world where information is power, investigators find the secrets others miss.

**Fictional Scale:** Solve Local Crime → Unravel Conspiracy → Decode Ancient Mysteries

## Scene Reader (Novice Tier)

**Advancement Trigger:** Successfully investigate a crime scene or significant event and deduce what actually happened

**Prerequisites:** None

### Features:

#### Observational Detail
**Mechanical Effect:** You notice details others miss. When examining a scene for clues, you have +1 Edge.

When you investigate a location, the GM must provide you with:
- At least one additional detail beyond what's obvious
- Physical evidence that reveals something about what happened
- One thing that doesn't fit or seems out of place

You can ask questions like "What looks disturbed?" or "What's missing?" and receive truthful answers.

**Act Interpretations:**
- Act 2: "Investigating recovered sites for Chronicle fragments"
- Act 4: "Analyzing resistance safe houses after raids"
- Act 5: "Reading AF64 operational sites for intelligence"

**Prerequisite for:** Evidence Analysis (Pattern Recognition)

#### Event Reconstruction
**Mechanical Effect:** You can reconstruct events from physical evidence. When examining a scene:
- You can determine the sequence of events
- You can identify how many people were involved
- You can estimate when events occurred
- You can deduce the general nature of what happened

Spend 1 Stress to force the GM to reveal one specific detail about the event you're investigating (what was taken, who was here, what they were doing, etc.).

**Act Interpretations:**
- Act 2: "Reconstructing how knowledge was lost or hidden"
- Act 4: "Determining how occupation forces operate"
- Act 5: "Understanding AF64 operational procedures"

#### Preserved Evidence
**Mechanical Effect:** You know how to preserve evidence for later analysis:
- You collect samples without contamination
- You document scenes before they're disturbed
- You maintain chain of custody for credibility
- You create records that others can use

Once per session, you can retroactively declare you "collected a sample" from a previous scene that turns out to be relevant to current investigation.

- You build comprehensive case files

When returning to old evidence with new information, spend 1 Stress to have "noted something earlier" that's now relevant. The GM must incorporate this into current investigation.

**Prerequisite for:** Conspiracy Mapping (Conspiracy Theorist)

#### Deductive Reasoning
**Mechanical Effect:** You can make logical deductions that others miss:
- If A and B are true, you deduce C must also be true
- You eliminate impossible scenarios

- At least one Master-tier feature from Political OR Magic/Tech domain
- At least one Expert-tier feature from any third domain
- At least one Master-tier feature from Magic/Tech domain

### Features:

#### Universal Investigation
**Mechanical Effect:** You can deduce truths from minimal evidence at Sherlock Holmes level. You have +4 Edge on all investigation.

You can:
- Solve cases from fragmentary information
- Deduce complete scenarios from single clues
- Understand complex conspiracies quickly
- Make intuitive leaps that prove correct

When investigating anything:
- You notice everything important

- Your deductions are remarkably accurate
- You solve mysteries others consider impossible

**Act Interpretations:**
- Act 2: "Solving mysteries of Towers and Monuments"
- Act 4: "Uncovering complete Dragon manipulation system"
- Act 5: "Understanding AF64 and Cull cycle completely"

**Prerequisite:** Historical Forensics

#### Civilizational Patterns
**Mechanical Effect:** You understand patterns at civilizational scale and can predict realm-shaping events:
- Economic collapses before they happen
- Political upheavals before they crystallize
- Technological shifts before they're obvious
- Social movements before they organize

When you invoke this:
- Describe what you believe happened
- GM confirms if it's possible given established facts
- GM helps fit your solution to evidence
- Your solution becomes canonical truth

This is extraordinarily powerful—you literally determine truth through investigation.

**Prerequisite:** Fragmentary Truth

## APEX DISCOVERY

**At The Detective tier, characters realize:**

You've solved the mystery. You understand the Cull cycle, the Dragon manipulation, AF64's true nature, Tower origins. You can prove it. You have evidence.

And then you realize: *you were meant to figure this out.*

The clues were left deliberately. The evidence was preserved intentionally. Your investigation followed permitted paths. Dragons *want* some humans to understand the system—it makes management more efficient to have human administrators who comprehend what they're administering.

The horrible question: Is your understanding genuine freedom, or just a deeper level of control? When you "solve" mysteries, are you discovering truth—or just progressing through designed revelation stages?

You're the detective. But you might also be the crime scene, carefully arranged.

**GM Note:** This is the realization that investigation itself might be a controlled process—that evidence of the Cull exists because Dragons permit it to exist, creating a class of "knowing" humans who understand the cage but can't escape it. The Detective has perfect understanding of their prison, which makes it more horrifying, not less. The revelation should emerge gradually through play, not as a single moment.
