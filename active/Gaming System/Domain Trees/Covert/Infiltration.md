# Infiltration Tree
## Penetrating Secure Locations and Organizations

This tree represents your ability to infiltrate secure locations and organizations, assuming identities, and operating undercover. Infiltration specialists penetrate defenses through deception rather than force, becoming trusted insiders rather than external threats. In a world of secrets and conspiracies, those who can become anyone, anywhere, hold extraordinary power.

**Fictional Scale:** Sneak into Manor → Infiltrate Guild → Penetrate Government → Compromise Dragon Operations

- Map interior layouts (from outside observations)
- Spot security measures (locks, alarms, watches)

#### Intelligence Extraction
**Mechanical Effect:** You can systematically extract intelligence from organizations you've infiltrated:

This is extraordinarily dangerous. Discovery means death. But you've done it.

When operating against Dragon Heralds:
- You have +3 Edge (reduced from normal +4 due to extreme danger)
- Spend 3 Stress per major Herald infiltration operation
- Success yields intelligence unavailable through other means

**Prerequisite:** Institutional Access

#### Deep Network
**Mechanical Effect:** You've created a network of deep cover operatives across civilization:
- Sleeper agents in every major institution
- Multiple identities you can assume anywhere
- Support infrastructure for infiltration operations
- Escape networks when covers are blown

Your infiltration network is itself a strategic asset—you can penetrate organizations at scale.

Security systems and magical wards struggle to track you (unless specifically designed to counter you). You're everywhere and nowhere.

Once per major campaign event, you can reveal that you (or your network) have been inside a critical organization all along, perfectly positioned to act.

**Prerequisite:** Sleeper Activation

## APEX DISCOVERY

**At The Faceless tier, characters realize:**

You can infiltrate anything. Any organization, any institution, any power structure. You've penetrated Dragon Herald operations. You're everywhere.

And then you notice: you succeed *too* consistently. Covers hold *too* well. Organizations accept you *too* easily. You start to suspect your infiltration success has been *permitted*—that something vast finds your presence useful.

The horrible question: Are you a successful infiltrator, or a tool for identifying dissidents? Do Dragons allow infiltration networks because having humans penetrate their own organizations makes it easier to map resistance? When you place sleeper agents, are you creating resistance infrastructure—or are you marking people for later elimination?

Your infiltration network might be the most sophisticated surveillance system ever created—and you built it yourself.

**GM Note:** This is the realization that infiltration networks might serve the Cull cycle—that Dragons permit and even facilitate certain infiltrations because they reveal who's dangerous, who can be trusted, and where resistance exists. The Faceless has created perfect intelligence infrastructure, but may be unknowingly working for the system they oppose. The revelation should emerge gradually through play, not as a single moment.
