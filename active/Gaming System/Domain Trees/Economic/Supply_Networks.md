# Supply Networks Tree
## Building and Maintaining Logistics and Supply Chains

This tree represents your ability to move goods, establish trade routes, and create the material infrastructure that enables operations. Supply Networks specialists make the impossible logistically feasible—they supply armies across hostile territory, smuggle critical resources, and create economic dependencies that shift political power.

**Fictional Scale:** Local Merchant → Regional Supplier → Continental Trade Network

---

## Trader (Novice Tier)

**Advancement Trigger:** Establish a profitable trade route or reliable supply relationship that persists for at least 3 sessions

**Prerequisites:** None

### Features:

#### Commercial Negotiation
**Mechanical Effect:** You have +1 Edge on all commercial negotiations (buying, selling, haggling, contract terms).

You understand the fundamentals of trade:
- Supply and demand dynamics
- Profit margins and pricing
- When to push for better terms vs. when to accept a deal
- How to assess quality and spot counterfeits

**Act Interpretations:**
- Act 2: "Trading recovered artifacts and ancient knowledge"
- Act 4: "Negotiating resistance supply contracts"
- Act 5: "Brokering deals between human realms and fleet suppliers"

#### Reliable Sources
**Mechanical Effect:** You maintain relationships with reliable suppliers. In any city or town you've spent at least one session in, you can:
- Locate sources for common goods within 1d6 hours
- Find specialized goods within 1 day (GM determines availability)
- Get fair prices (no gouging unless supplies are genuinely scarce)

Once per session, you can retroactively declare you had already sourced something you need. Spend 1 Stress and you "happen to know a guy" who can supply it.

**Act Interpretations:**
- Act 2: "Networks of knowledge traders and artifact dealers"
- Act 4: "Resistance-friendly merchants and smugglers"
- Act 5: "Fleet quartermasters and human suppliers"

**Prerequisite for:** Trade Route Establishment (Supply Coordinator)

#### Market Sense
**Mechanical Effect:** You can quickly assess local market conditions. When entering a new settlement or market, you automatically know:
- What goods are abundant vs. scarce
- Approximate fair prices for common items
- Whether prices are being manipulated
- If there are shortages or surpluses coming (within next week)

This helps you avoid being cheated and spot profitable opportunities.

## Supply Coordinator (Journeyman Tier)

**Advancement Trigger:** Successfully manage complex supply needs for an organization, expedition, or campaign (supplying 50+ people for at least 5 sessions)

**Prerequisites:** At least one feature from Trader

### Features:

#### Trade Route Establishment
**Mechanical Effect:** You can establish formal trade routes between locations. When you establish a route:
- Define start point, end point, and what goods flow
- The route becomes reliable (barring major disruption like war or bandits)
- You gain +2 Edge on all logistics planning using this route
- You have transport contracts, warehouses, and partners along the route

You can maintain up to 3 active trade routes simultaneously. Each route generates passive income (GM determines based on volume and goods—enough to cover modest lifestyle expenses per route).

**Act Interpretations:**
- Act 2: "Knowledge-sharing routes between Tower cities"
- Act 4: "Smuggling routes for resistance supply"
- Act 5: "Trade lanes between human settlements and fleet bases"

**Prerequisite:** Reliable Sources  
**Prerequisite for:** Regional Trade Network (Trade Network Master)

#### Supply Calculation
**Mechanical Effect:** You can accurately calculate supply needs for any operation. When planning expeditions, campaigns, or projects:
- You know exactly what's needed (food, equipment, replacements, contingencies)
- You can estimate costs within 10% accuracy
- You identify critical supply bottlenecks before they become problems
- You plan for spoilage, theft, and unexpected needs

When you manage supply for a group operation, the operation suffers no penalties from supply shortages or equipment failure (assuming you had time to properly provision).

**Prerequisite for:** Contingency Planning (Trade Network Master)

#### Bulk Purchasing
**Mechanical Effect:** You know how to buy in volume and get wholesale prices. When purchasing supplies:
- Reduce costs by 20% for bulk orders
- You can arrange credit with known merchants (pay later)
- You can source large quantities that aren't normally available retail
- You have relationships with manufacturers and producers, not just shopkeepers

Once per session, when you need expensive supplies urgently, spend 2 Stress to have "already placed the order last week"—the supplies arrive just when needed.

## Trade Network Master (Adept Tier)

**Advancement Trigger:** Build a trade network spanning multiple cities or controlling an entire region's supply of a specific commodity

**Prerequisites:**
- Trade Route Establishment (Economic: Supply Networks)
- At least one feature from Political domain OR Covert domain

### Features:

#### Regional Trade Network
**Mechanical Effect:** You control a network of trade routes connecting multiple markets (at least 3 cities/towns). Your network includes:
- Multiple warehouses across the region
- Transport contracts (ships, caravans, wagons)
- Reliable business partners in each location
- Financial instruments (letters of credit, banking relationships)

You have +2 Edge on all supply and trade operations within your network. You can move goods efficiently—what normally takes weeks takes days through your established channels.

Your network generates substantial passive income (enough to maintain wealthy lifestyle and fund operations).

**Act Interpretations:**
- Act 2: "Regional knowledge exchange and artifact trade network"
- Act 4: "Multi-city resistance supply coordination"
- Act 5: "Human economic zone trade infrastructure"

**Prerequisite:** Trade Route Establishment  
**Prerequisite for:** Continental Supply Lines (Continental Merchant)

#### Strategic Stockpiling
**Mechanical Effect:** You maintain strategic stockpiles of critical goods in your warehouses. You can:
- Store large quantities of supplies against future need
- Weather price fluctuations (buy low, sell high)
- Supply operations immediately without sourcing delays
- Manipulate local markets through controlled release of stockpiled goods

Once per arc, you can reveal that you "saw this coming" and have already stockpiled exactly what's needed for the current crisis. Spend 3 Stress to produce large quantities of critical supplies from your warehouses.

**Act Interpretations:**
- Act 2: "Stockpiled ancient texts and recovered artifacts"
- Act 4: "Hidden weapons, food, and medical supply caches"
- Act 5: "Strategic reserves for human-fleet negotiations"

#### Contingency Planning
**Mechanical Effect:** You always have backup plans for supply disruptions. When your primary supply route is disrupted:
- You have alternate routes already identified
- You maintain redundant suppliers for critical goods
- You can reroute supplies within 1d6 hours
- Your operations continue without major delays

Additionally, when any operation you've provisioned faces unexpected supply needs, you can spend 1 Stress to have "brought extras just in case."

**Prerequisite:** Supply Calculation

## Continental Merchant (Expert Tier)

**Advancement Trigger:** Establish a trade network that spans multiple realms or crosses the continent, becoming essential to regional economy

**Prerequisites:**
- Regional Trade Network (Economic: Supply Networks)
- At least one feature from Political: Alliance Building OR Covert: Intelligence Networks
- At least one feature from Martial: Logistics & Supply

### Features:

#### Continental Supply Lines
**Mechanical Effect:** Your trade network operates at continental scale, spanning multiple realms and cultures. You can:
- Move goods across hostile borders
- Supply armies, cities, or major projects anywhere in your network
- Coordinate maritime, river, and land routes simultaneously
- Operate in war zones and disputed territories

You have +3 Edge on all economic operations within your network.

Rulers and generals must negotiate with you for supply access. You can grant or deny supply to entire campaigns.

**Act Interpretations:**

- Act 4: "Multi-realm resistance coordination and supply"
- Act 5: "Human-controlled trade spanning multiple fleet sectors"

**Prerequisite:** Regional Trade Network  
**Prerequisite for:** Resource Monopoly (Supply Monopolist)

#### Crisis Supply
**Mechanical Effect:** You specialize in supplying operations others consider impossible. When tasked with supplying something difficult (army in hostile territory, city under siege, expedition to dangerous region):
- You identify solutions others don't see (smuggling routes, neutral intermediaries, creative workarounds)
- You have +3 Edge on crisis supply operations
- You can supply operations in conditions that would normally make it impossible

Once per major operation, you can spend 3 Stress to declare that you've "already solved this problem" and have supplies positioned exactly where needed through some clever arrangement you made weeks ago.

**Act Interpretations:**
- Act 2: "Supplying expeditions to sealed Tower sections"
- Act 4: "Running supplies through occupation blockades"
- Act 5: "Delivering critical resources across fleet quarantine zones"

#### Diplomatic Supply Access
**Mechanical Effect:** Your supply network gives you diplomatic leverage. You can:
- Offer supply access as political inducement
- Deny supply to pressure political outcomes
- Broker deals where supply is the currency
- Create economic dependencies that shift political allegiance

When negotiating with factions or realms that need your supplies, you have +2 Edge on political negotiations. They need you more than you need them.

**Prerequisite for:** Economic Leverage (Supply Monopolist)

---

## Supply Monopolist (Master Tier)

**Advancement Trigger:** Achieve monopoly or dominant market position in a critical resource (grain, metals, luxury goods, weapons, specific trade commodity)

**Prerequisites:**
- Continental Supply Lines (Economic: Supply Networks)
- At least one feature from Political: Treaty Crafting OR Political: Authority & Legitimacy
- At least one Master-tier feature from any other domain

### Features:

#### Resource Monopoly
**Mechanical Effect:** You control or dominate supply of a critical commodity across multiple realms. When you control supply:
- You set prices (within reason—you can't price yourself out of market)
- You can favor allies and deny enemies
- Disrupting your monopoly requires significant effort and resources
- Your decisions affect prices and availability across realms

You have +3 Edge on all negotiations involving your monopolized resource.

Leaders must negotiate with you for access. Your refusal can cripple military campaigns, construction projects, or political initiatives that depend on your commodity.

**Act Interpretations:**
- Act 2: "Control of recovered Monument component trade"
- Act 4: "Monopoly on resistance weapons and ammunition supply"
- Act 5: "Exclusive human access to certain fleet technologies"

**Prerequisite:** Continental Supply Lines

#### Economic Warfare
**Mechanical Effect:** You can weaponize supply control against enemies. You can:
- Starve enemy operations by denying supply
- Inflate prices to drain enemy resources
- Create artificial shortages in enemy territory
- Flood enemy markets to crash prices and harm their economy

When targeting an enemy with economic warfare:
- Spend 2 Stress to create a supply crisis for a specific operation
- Spend 4 Stress to create realm-wide economic disruption
- The GM determines specific effects, but they should be significant

This is warfare without armies—you destroy enemy capability through logistics.

**Act Interpretations:**
- Act 2: "Economic pressure on Tower cities hoarding knowledge"
- Act 4: "Starving occupation forces through supply denial"
- Act 5: "Economic leverage against hostile fleet elements"

#### Economic Leverage
**Mechanical Effect:** Your supply network creates political leverage. Realms become dependent on your network for:
- Essential resources (food, weapons, construction materials)
- Luxury goods that maintain elite support
- Specialized items that enable specific capabilities

When negotiating with dependent realms:
- You can demand political concessions in exchange for continued supply
- You can threaten supply disruption to influence policy
- Leaders must consider your position before making decisions that might displease you

You are no longer just a merchant—you are a political force that realms must accommodate.

**Prerequisite:** Diplomatic Supply Access

## Economic Hegemon (Apex Tier)

**Advancement Trigger:** Your supply networks become the foundational infrastructure of civilization—continental trade routes flow through your network, and major operations cannot proceed without your coordination

**Prerequisites:**
- Resource Monopoly (Economic: Supply Networks)
- At least one Master-tier feature from Political domain
- At least one Master-tier feature from Covert OR Martial domain
- At least one Expert-tier feature from any third domain

### Features:

#### Infrastructure of Civilization
**Mechanical Effect:** Your supply network is THE economic infrastructure that civilization depends on. You control:
- Major trade routes across the continent
- Critical transportation nodes (ports, crossroads, passes)
- Warehousing and distribution throughout realms
- Banking and credit systems that enable trade

You have +4 Edge on all economic operations. Your network is studied as an institutional achievement.

Realms rise and fall based on their access to your network. Being cut off from your trade routes is economic catastrophe.

**Act Interpretations:**
- Act 2: "The supply network that enables planetary knowledge recovery"
- Act 4: "The logistics backbone of continental resistance"
- Act 5: "The human economic system that fleet command must negotiate with"

#### Determine What Moves
**Mechanical Effect:** You decide what goods move where. You can:
- Prioritize certain routes or customers over others
- Embargo entire realms or factions
- Create or destroy economic prosperity through supply decisions
- Make certain operations possible or impossible through logistics

Once per major political development, you can spend 5 Stress to declare that you've "arranged the supply situation" such that a specific outcome becomes inevitable. For example:
- An invasion fails due to supply collapse
- A realm must accept terms because you control all food imports
- A rebellion succeeds because you supply them while denying the occupation

The GM determines exact effects, but they should be realm-shaping.

**Act Interpretations:**
- Act 2: "Determining which Tower cities recover which knowledge"
- Act 4: "Deciding which rebellion cells can operate effectively"
- Act 5: "Controlling which human realms can negotiate from strength with fleet"

#### Even Dragons Need Supply
**Mechanical Effect:** You've reached the tier where even Dragons must account for your economic power. Dragons can destroy your warehouses and kill your merchants—but they cannot easily replace the supply infrastructure you've created.

When dealing with Dragon authorities or Dragon-backed powers:
- You have +2 Edge on negotiations (your economic leverage is real)
- Dragons recognize you as managing critical infrastructure they depend on
- Destroying you creates economic chaos that disrupts their managed order
- You can (carefully) use supply as negotiating leverage even with Dragons

This doesn't make you equal to Dragons in power—but it makes you too valuable to casually destroy and too important to ignore.

**Act Interpretations:**
- Act 2: "Tower cities need your distribution network for recovery coordination"
- Act 4: "Occupation depends on your supply routes to maintain order"
- Act 5: "Fleet logistics require your human economic infrastructure"

## APEX DISCOVERY

**At Economic Hegemon tier, characters begin to notice:**

Your supply network works *too* smoothly. Trade routes that should be disrupted remain open. Blockades you should face mysteriously lift. Critical supplies you need become available at convenient times. You start to suspect your economic power has been *permitted* to grow—that something vast finds your network useful.

The horrible question: Are you building genuine economic independence, or are you constructing the supply infrastructure that makes the Cull cycle more efficient? Do Dragons allow your network to flourish because it concentrates economic power into manageable channels?

When you supply rebellions, are you enabling resistance or organizing the next harvest's targets into neat, trackable logistics networks?

**GM Note:** This is the realization that economic hegemonies might exist by design—that Dragons permit merchant princes because centralized supply networks are easier to monitor and control than distributed local economies. The Economic Hegemon has built the infrastructure that makes civilization manageable. The revelation should emerge gradually through play, not as a single moment.
