# Exotic Energy Manipulation Tree
## Understanding and Manipulating Tower Subparticle Energy

This tree represents your ability to sense, understand, and manipulate the exotic subparticle energy that leaks from the Towers. Exotic Energy Manipulation specialists work directly with the fundamental forces that make "magic" possible on Orbis, learning to shape and direct energies that transformed the planet. In a world where reality itself has been rewritten by exotic particles, those who can manipulate the source wield profound power.

**Fictional Scale:** Sense Energy → Shape Energy → Master Energy

## APEX DISCOVERY

**At Living Tower tier, characters realize:**

You've become living exotic energy. You can manipulate power at Tower AI levels. You could potentially reactivate ship systems. You've transcended humanity through energy.

And then you understand: energy manipulation at this scale was *impossible* until you achieved it. The barriers that prevented this weren't just technical—they were systematically maintained. You start to suspect that achieving ultimate energy manipulation has been *permitted* at exactly this moment—that something vast finds your transcendence useful.

The horrible question: Did you achieve energy mastery, or were you *allowed* to achieve it? Do Dragons permit ultimate energy manipulation because humans who transcend flesh are easier to identify and eliminate than those who remain hidden in biological limitations? When you become pure energy, are you free—or have you made yourself the brightest possible target?

Your energy transcendence might trigger exactly the response it was designed to trigger—the final Cull.

**GM Note:** This is the most dangerous Apex Discovery—the realization that achieving ultimate power might be exactly what Dragons have been waiting for. The Living Tower has become powerful enough to threaten the system, which means they've become dangerous enough to justify extinction. This should be the discovery that makes clear the true nature of permitted progress—humans are allowed to climb until they become threatening enough to harvest. The revelation should emerge gradually through play, not as a single moment, and should create genuine existential terror about what the character has become.
