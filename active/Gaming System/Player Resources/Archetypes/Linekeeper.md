## The Continuity Guardian

---

> *"I am the thread connecting past to future. What came before speaks through me to what comes after. I preserve what must not be lost."*

---

## Core Philosophy

The Linekeeper's identity is defined by **preservation and continuity**. You are the guardian of tradition, the keeper of lineage, the bearer of institutional memory. You connect past to future.

This isn't about rigidity—it's about **responsibility**. The past has wisdom. The future deserves to receive it. You are the bridge.

### What Drives a Linekeeper?

**Continuity as Sacred**: The thread must not break
- You preserve what previous generations built
- Traditions encode hard-won wisdom
- Breaking continuity wastes ancestral sacrifice
- You are responsible to past AND future

**Memory as Duty**: Someone must remember
- Important truths must be preserved
- Cultural memory sustains communities
- Forgetting is a form of death
- You bear the weight of remembrance

**Tradition as Foundation**: The old ways have value
- Change requires justification
- Innovation built on preserved knowledge
- Institutions outlive individuals through continuity
- You maintain what endures

---

## When You Get Edge

Linekeepers gain **+1 to +2 Edge** when:

### Preserving & Recording
- **Documenting important events** for future memory
- **Maintaining traditions** and cultural practices
- **Recovering lost knowledge** that should be preserved
- **Acting as witness** to significant moments

### Upholding Continuity
- **Defending institutions** from disruption
- **Maintaining lineages** (family, organization, tradition)
- **Following precedent** and established procedure
- **Resisting disruptive change** without justification

### Connecting Past to Future
- **Invoking historical precedent** to guide present
- **Teaching traditions** to next generation
- **Preserving artifacts** and records
- **Honoring ancestors** and lineage

## Linekeeper Dilemmas

### The Harmful Tradition

**Dilemma**: A tradition you preserve is **harmful** (oppressive, unjust, outdated).

Do you:
- Preserve it anyway (tradition über alles)
- Let it die (selective preservation)
- Preserve but contextualize (historical record, not active practice)

**Moral Friction**:
- Abandoning tradition: +4 to +6
- Preserving harmful tradition: Depends on personal principles

### The Dangerous Truth

**Dilemma**: You've preserved knowledge that's **dangerous**—could harm people, destabilize society, attract Draconic Attention.

Do you:
- Keep it secret (responsible preservation)
- Reveal it (truth over safety)
- Destroy it (safety over preservation)

**Linekeeper Tragedy**: Destroying knowledge **betrays your core identity**—but preserving it might harm people.

### The Lost Lineage

**Dilemma**: A tradition/lineage is **dying**. You're the last keeper.

If you don't pass it on, it **dies with you**.

But there are **no worthy successors** (everyone is incompetent, disrespectful, or disinterested).

**What do you do?**

**Options**:
- Train unworthy successor (tradition survives, degraded)
- Let it die with you (maintain purity, lose continuity)
- Record it completely (preserve knowledge without living tradition)

### The Innovation vs Tradition Conflict

**Dilemma**: Someone proposes **innovation** that **improves** on tradition.

Traditional method: Slower but proven
Innovative method: Faster but untested

**Do you resist improvement to preserve tradition?**

**Linekeeper Growth**: Learning that **preservation doesn't mean stagnation**—traditions can evolve.

---

## Linekeeper Philosophy

### The Thread Must Not Break

**Core Belief**: Continuity from past to future is **sacred**.

When continuity breaks:
- Institutional knowledge is lost
- Communities lose identity
- Ancestral wisdom is wasted

Linekeepers maintain the **thread**—they are the connection.

### Memory as Responsibility

**Burden of Remembrance**: You **must** remember. It's not optional.

What you forget, **the world forgets**.

This is:
- Heavy (carrying weight of memory)
- Sacred (you're trusted with this)
- Essential (someone must do it)

### Tradition as Encoded Wisdom

**Why Preserve Tradition?**: It contains **lessons learned through suffering**.

Traditions exist because:
- Ancestors tried alternatives that failed
- Practices that work get passed down
- Cultural solutions encode local wisdom

**Dismissing tradition = dismissing ancestral wisdom.**

But **evaluating** tradition ≠ dismissing it.

## Advancement Advice

### Early Game (Novice-Journeyman)

- Build reputation for accurate preservation
- Begin documenting or maintaining important knowledge

**Domain Recommendation**: Spiritual (Lore Understanding) or Magic/Tech (Chronicle Decipherment)

**Habit Building**: Systematic documentation, careful preservation

### Mid Game (Adept-Expert)

- Recover lost knowledge
- Become institutional memory keeper
- Build archives or preservation systems

**Domain Recommendation**: Spiritual + Magic/Tech (if preserving Chronicles) or Spiritual + Political (if maintaining institutions)

**Reputation**: Continental recognition as preservation authority

### Late Game (Master-Apex)

**Focus**: Become living embodiment of continuity
- You ARE the institutional/cultural memory
- What you preserve survives; what you forget dies
- Build systems that preserve beyond your death

**Domain Recommendation**: Master-tier Spiritual (cultural memory), possibly Magic/Tech (complete Chronicles)

**Legacy Goal**: Create **preservation systems** that outlive you—archives, institutions, trained successors

## Linekeeper and Draconic Attention

**Generally Low Risk**: Preserving tradition doesn't threaten Dragons

**Moderate Risk** (+2-4):
- Preserving political traditions that challenge Dragon authority
- Maintaining institutional memory that questions Dragon legitimacy

**High Risk** (+6-8):
- Preserving complete Chronicle records (Earth-Colony-Shattering truth)
- Teaching civilization its true origin
- Maintaining records Dragons want erased

**Linekeeper Dilemma**: If Dragons order you to **destroy** records, **do you?**

Destroying knowledge is **core betrayal** (+6 Moral Friction)—but defying Dragons is **suicidal**.

Many Linekeepers choose **martyrdom** over erasure.
