## The Boundary-Walker

---

> *"The edge is where life happens. Safe is slow death. I walk the line between worlds, and I thrive there."*

---

## Core Philosophy

The Edgerunner's identity is defined by **boundary-walking**. You exist in liminal spaces—between nations, between legal and illegal, between safe and deadly. You don't just tolerate risk—you **need** it.

This isn't recklessness (though it can look like it). It's about thriving in spaces where normal rules don't apply.

### What Drives an Edgerunner?

**Risk as Life**: Safety is stagnation
- Calculated risks reveal truth
- Danger sharpens perception
- Comfort is slow death
- You feel most alive on the edge

**Boundary Spaces**: The in-between is where you belong
- Geographic edges (borders, frontiers)
- Social edges (between cultures, classes)
- Legal edges (grey areas of law)
- Conceptual edges (between possible and impossible)

**Freedom Over Security**: You cannot be caged
- Rules are suggestions
- Authority is provisional
- You live on your own terms
- Constraints suffocate you

---

## When You Get Edge

Edgerunners gain **+1 to +2 Edge** when:

### Taking Calculated Risks
- **Operating in high-risk** situations where others would retreat
- **Pushing boundaries** others respect (social, legal, physical)
- **Making risky gambles** with potential high payoff
- **Improvising under pressure** when plans fall apart

### Boundary Walking
- **Operating in border spaces** (geographic, social, legal)
- **Navigating between factions** without full commitment to either
- **Working in grey areas** where normal rules don't apply
- **Crossing forbidden lines** others won't cross

### Freedom & Improvisation
- **Adapting quickly** when circumstances change
- **Operating independently** without structure or authority
- **Breaking constraints** that limit others
- **Choosing freedom** over safety or security

---

## Edgerunner Principles

Your **Moral Profile** likely includes principles like:

### Core Principles (Weight 3)

- "Risk reveals truth that safety hides"
- "I walk edges others fear"

- "Comfort is stagnation"
- "I live on my own terms"

### Personal Principles (Weight 1)

- "The forbidden is worth exploring"
- "Better to burn bright than fade away"

### Moral Friction Triggers

**Minor Bend (+2 Difficulty)**:

- Following rules without questioning them
- Accepting imposed limits

**Significant Compromise (+4 Difficulty)**:
- Choosing security over freedom
- Submitting to authority you could resist
- Avoiding risk entirely

**Core Betrayal (+6 Difficulty)**:
- Accepting permanent constraints (cage, oath binding you, safe conventional life)
- Abandoning freedom for security
- Becoming what you reject (conventional, safe, bound)

## Edgerunner Dilemmas

### The Commitment Problem

**Dilemma**: Someone you care about demands **commitment**—loyalty, permanence, constraint.

But commitment means **constraint**. Edgerunners resist constraint.

**Can you commit without losing yourself?**

**Moral Friction**: Depends
- Commitment to person: Maybe acceptable
- Commitment to institution: Significant Compromise (+4)
- Permanent constraint: Core Betrayal (+6)

### The Risk That Went Too Far

**Dilemma**: Your risk-taking hurt someone else (not just you).

Now what?

**Edgerunner Response** varies:
- "Not my problem" (sociopathic)
- "I'll be more careful" (growth)
- "Maybe I need limits" (transformation)
- "This is why I work alone" (isolation)

### The Safe Option

**Dilemma**: The smart, safe plan is **right there**. Taking the risk is **stupid**.

But you're an Edgerunner. Safe feels wrong.

**Do you take the unnecessary risk?**

**Moral Friction**: +2 to +4 to play it safe (depending on how safe)

### The Cage Made of Gold

**Dilemma**: Someone offers you **everything you want**—wealth, power, security.

Price: Give up freedom. Accept constraint. Stay in one place, serve one master.

**Do you accept the gilded cage?**

**Moral Friction**: Core Betrayal (+6) to accept permanent constraint

---

## Edgerunner Philosophy

### Freedom Is Everything

**Core Value**: You would rather **die free** than **live constrained**.

This isn't philosophical abstraction—it's **identity**. Constraint kills what you are.

### The Edge Is Where Life Happens

**Risk as Vitality**: Safe is **slow death**.

Edgerunners feel most **alive** when on the edge:
- Physical risk (danger)
- Social risk (boundary-crossing)
- Legal risk (operating in grey areas)

**The edge sharpens perception, forces presence, eliminates numbness.**

### No Masters

**Autonomy**: You serve yourself, no one else.

This makes you:
- Unreliable to authority
- Valuable to those who need independence
- Dangerous to systems that require loyalty

High-tier Edgerunners are **ungovernable**.

## Advancement Advice

### Early Game (Novice-Journeyman)

**Focus**: Establish yourself as boundary-crosser
- Build reputation for going where others won't
- Develop survival skills (you take risks—don't die stupidly)
- Find your edge (which boundaries do you walk?)

**Domain Recommendation**: Covert (Infiltration) or Economic (Smuggling/Grey Market)

**Survival Priority**: Risk-taking without dying requires **skill**

### Mid Game (Adept-Expert)

**Focus**: Master boundary-walking at scale
- Operate in spaces normal people can't exist
- Build networks across boundaries
- Become essential because you go where others won't

**Domain Recommendation**: Multi-domain—boundary-walking enables access to all domains

**Reputation**: Known for doing impossible things

### Late Game (Master-Apex)

**Focus**: Exist entirely outside normal systems
- No faction claims you
- No government controls you
- You are **free** in ways others can't comprehend

**Domain Recommendation**: Political + Covert + Economic = complete independence

**Legacy**: You prove **freedom is possible**—you're living proof systems can't cage everyone

## Edgerunner and Draconic Attention

**Edgerunner Curse**: You **attract** Draconic Attention because you push boundaries.

**High-Risk Actions**:
- Approaching Towers (+4 to +8 Severity)
- Smuggling Monument artifacts (+4)
- Operating across realm boundaries Dragons want enforced (+2 to +4)
- Exploring forbidden knowledge (+6 to +8)

**Edgerunner Advantage**: You're **already** operating at edge—you know when you're crossing into dangerous territory.

**Edgerunner Temptation**: But the **forbidden is so interesting**...

Many Edgerunners die from Draconic Attention. Hazard of the lifestyle.
