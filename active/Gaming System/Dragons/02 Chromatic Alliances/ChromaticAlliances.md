# Chromatic Alliances
As the [[Council of Ancients]] is dominated by these dragons, the [[Sovereign Realms of Orbis]] would be in severe trouble at all times if not for the vain in fighting over individual power and position, amongst these groups.
## Notable Alliances Among the More Destructive Dragons

The **Chromatic Alliances** of [[Orbis]] are formed by dragons who embody chaos, ambition, and domination. Chromatic dragons—[[active/Gaming System/Dragons/02 Chromatic Alliances/Red Dragon|red]], [[active/Gaming System/Dragons/02 Chromatic Alliances/Blue Dragon|blue]], [[active/Gaming System/Dragons/02 Chromatic Alliances/Black Dragon|black]], [[active/Gaming System/Dragons/02 Chromatic Alliances/Green Dragon|green]], and [[active/Gaming System/Dragons/02 Chromatic Alliances/White Dragon|white]]—are known for their pride and independence, making long-lasting alliances rare and fragile. However, when their interests align, they become unstoppable forces of destruction, capable of toppling empires and reshaping continents. These alliances are often driven by greed, vengeance, or a shared hatred of mortal civilizations. While their internal politics are rife with distrust and betrayals, their combined strength can overwhelm even the mightiest armies.

### **Overview of Chromatic Power Structures**

The power structures within chromatic alliances are volatile by nature. Ancient chromatic dragons demand absolute deference from their kin and mortal servants, leading to hierarchical coalitions often held together by fear, brute strength, or temporary mutual interests.

## **Leadership Hierarchies**:

### **The Tyrant Model**:
In many chromatic alliances, an ancient red or blue dragon assumes the role of the supreme leader, commanding through raw power and promises of glory. Subordinate dragons are expected to swear fealty or risk destruction.

### **The Pact of Equals**:
Some alliances, such as the **Green Dragon Lineage**, operate as loose coalitions of equals where decisions are made through negotiation—albeit with frequent threats and posturing.

### **Enforced Loyalty**:
Chromatic leaders often use magical oaths, cursed treasures, or draconic progeny as leverage to keep lesser dragons in line. Breaking these bonds can lead to deadly power struggles within the alliance.

### **Objectives and Goals**: Common motivations for chromatic alliances

### **Hoard Expansion**:
The desire for treasure—whether gold, enchanted relics, or powerful artifacts—drives many chromatic dragons to join forces. Together, they can plunder entire regions, splitting the spoils or hoarding rival troves.

### **Territorial Dominance**:
Chromatic dragons often ally to secure vast domains where they can establish lairs, hunt freely, and reign without challenge. These alliances are particularly common in resource-rich lands and planar rift zones.

### **Destruction and Subjugation**:
Some alliances seek to eradicate civilizations that they view as threats or nuisances. This is especially true for alliances involving red and black dragons, who revel in the annihilation of mortal creations.

### **Revenge Pacts**:
Past defeats can drive chromatic dragons to form alliances out of a shared desire for vengeance, particularly against metallic dragons or factions that have opposed them.

## **Famous Alliances**
Throughout the history of Orbis, chromatic alliances have risen to power and left their mark in the form of ruined cities, scorched lands, and haunted coastlines. These alliances are remembered in both cautionary tales and tragic epics.

### **The Verdant Reclaimers**

### **Description**:
A conclave of green dragons who believe they are the rightful custodians of Orbis’ ancient forests. Led by the enigmatic **Sylvrath the Verdant Tyrant**, the Reclaimers see all mortal incursions into forests as an affront to their draconic dominion.

### **Philosophy**:
The Verdant Reclaimers view themselves as guardians of primordial power, but their methods involve using venom, fear, and manipulation to reclaim lands that they believe were stolen by mortals.

### **Key Conflict**:

The **Verdant Warpath** saw the Reclaimers overrun outposts along the Celanthari border, poisoning rivers and luring settlements into ruin with enchanted mists.

### **Outcome**:

The Reclaimers’ advance was halted when an alliance of Etrivallan shamans and Celanthari druids invoked a massive **Rite of Verdant Sundering**, severing the ley lines that the green dragons had corrupted to fuel their magic. Sylvrath retreated to his lair, where he is believed to be biding his time and gathering strength.

### **“The Stormseer’s Rebellion”**:
A powerful stormcaller claims to wield the power of the [[active/Gaming System/Dragons/02 Chromatic Alliances/Veilstorm Accord]] and threatens to drown an entire duchy unless her demands are met. The players must discover whether her claims are true or if she is a pawn in a larger draconic scheme.

### **“The Verdant Covenant”**:
A council of green dragon emissaries invites the Celanthari and Etrivallan tribes to a parley, promising peace if their sacred groves are returned. The players are tasked with mediating the tense negotiations or exposing the dragons' true intentions.
