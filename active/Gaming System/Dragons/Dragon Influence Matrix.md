## Historical Precedents

Throughout Orbis history, dragon conflicts have coincided with major human wars. Previous documented instances include:

- **The Sundering Wars** (712-718) - Ignarath the Scorched Tyrant's manipulation of multiple kingdoms led to devastating conflict
- **The Winter of Ash** (890-892) - Chemraza the Venombinder's corruption of food supplies triggered regional famines and subsequent wars
- **The Coastal Campaigns** (1023-1031) - Vorthyx the Warden of Storms' weather manipulation disrupted shipping, causing economic collapse and military conflict

## Current Trajectory Analysis

The current pattern of chromatic dragon influence shows a coordinated effort to:

1. Disrupt economic stability (Vorthyx targeting trade routes with weather manipulation)
2. Undermine political alliances (Chemraza corrupting diplomatic channels)
3. Prepare for military escalation (Ignarath fostering warmongering factions)
4. Control key resources (Sylvrath manipulating natural resources)

The metallic dragons, severely diminished in number from previous conflicts, are focused on:

1. Information gathering rather than direct confrontation (Velthoryn)
2. Recruiting human agents to extend their influence
3. Protecting key locations and artifacts (Maltherion)
4. The absence of Aurenstraal the Dawnwing Ascendant creates a dangerous power vacuum

Without intervention, analysis suggests a continental war will erupt within 8-16 months, with the following projected outcomes:

- Multiple human realms severely weakened by conflict
- Chromatic dragon territorial expansion
- Further reduction in metallic dragon numbers
- Significant civilian casualties and economic collapse in border regions

## Adventure Hooks

1. **Dragon Scale Diplomacy** - Recovered scales from Chemraza could provide evidence of manipulation to prevent war
2. **Ancient Archives** - A hidden library maintained by Velthoryn contains information about how previous dragon-influenced wars were averted
3. **Double Agents** - A seemingly Vorthyx-aligned faction may be working secretly for metallic interests
4. **Draconic Artifacts** - Ancient items that could tip the balance of power are being sought by multiple dragon factions
5. **Gem Dragon Mysteries** - Zythara and Ithryzkal's psionic manipulations may be affecting leaders' decision-making abilities
6. **Deep Dragon Corruption** - Droskithar's ley line manipulation threatens magical stability across the continent

## Critical Information Gaps

- The extent of Vurmyzzeth's undead network across the continent
- The extent of Ignarath's infiltration in Luminarian military leadership
- Whether Sylvrath and Vorthyx are coordinating their efforts
- The location of the last remaining dragon eggs of both chromatic and metallic varieties
- The true nature of Ormyra and her agenda
