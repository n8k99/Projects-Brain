# Chapter: Ceremony of Eviction

## ✅Scene1-Clanging Of the Mine Bell
- Hatfield gathers at the Mine Entrance; Korrallan is brought up from the deep, formally exiled under opaque Ember Trial decrees.  

## ✅Scene2-With A Key
 
- Korrallan announces he will go to the Roadmarker of Sundering.  

## ✅Scene3- Without Instructions

- Seldiesal’s prophecy in the plaza marks him for the Sundering Stone. 
- The group walks out of Hatfield with no official escort, through High Nook Valley; early road scenes establish personalities, Korrallan’s unease under open sky, and background hints of Ruby Circle / Forge King politics around his exile.

# Chapter: Den of Bandits

## Scene4- Towards the River
- Approaching the Rarhoci and main trade road: caravans, rumors of kobold attacks, quiet talk of “a dwarf from the deep changing a stone.”  
- The party chooses a less-visible river crossing; distant watchers are seen on ridges, but not identified.  

## Scene5- Chase Uphill
- Kobold ambush near the river; frantic climb along bad terrain as the ambush escalates and they are driven toward the mountainside.  

## Scene6- Mouth of the Red Dragon
- Flight into the Den of Ghesh-Balor to escape the overwhelming horde; first dungeon crawl as they cross the “red dragon mouth” threshold.  
- This begins their first extended fight to survive, setting up the Iron-Fisted Stronghold chapter.

# Chapter: Rarhoci River Run

## 🎬Path Of Least Resistance
- Traveling along the Rarhoci after the Den, the party follows the easiest route onward.  
- They finally press Korrallan to explain what the Ember Trial actually was.  
- Korrallan begins telling the story in his own voice: glimpses of the trial chamber, Durnek under pressure, the Bravone name used against them.  

## Rise of the Crimson Dynasty
- Following Vanya’s lead, they reach the Ruined Chambers of the Vampire Knight; constant rat swarms and incomplete exploration keep pressure high.  
- Grimnar Coalborn appears as a traveling Emberborn cleric-patron, scarred and intense.  
  - He does not realize Korrallan is that Bravone; he just sees competent delvers near ruins he cares about.  
  - He offers coin and future patronage to have them seek a relic (the Crimson Codex) in the dungeon.  

## Turned Away
- The party is ultimately “Turned Away” by the dungeon’s hazards and endless rat pressure.  
- They leave with only partial clues about the Crimson Codex and the Crimson Empire, and Grimnar’s interest is now hooked.

# Chapter: Heights of Time

## Scene10-Night Camp Ember Trial
- Camped in the open after Turned Away, the group rests.  
- Korrallan drifts into deeper, more focused recollection as he sleeps: a more complete Ember Trial sequence, Durnek’s efforts to curry favor with Deep Dwarves, ancestral Bravone Emberborn / War of Ash and Iron betrayal named or implied, and Korrallan’s exile shown as political sacrifice as well as “justice.”  

## Scene11-Emberborn Moves
- Parallel scene at Grimnar’s campsite: kobolds driven from the Den of Ghesh-Balor meet him using familiar signals, revealing this is not their first contact.  
- Their implied report gives Grimnar details: a surface dwarf named Bravone, companions, ruins visited, direction of travel.  
- Grimnar realizes the Bravone connection and updates his agenda; it becomes clear he has been funding kobold harassment in the valley and now sees unexpected value in this particular exile.

# Chapter: Palace of Aria

## Scene12-Sharam Tomb The Promise
- The party reaches the Sharam tomb and resolves supernatural unrest by promising to bear witness to the victims’ stories and record their names.  
- Korrallan participates actively, committing to public truth rather than silence.  

## Scene13-Sharam Tomb Three-Way Standoff
- Grimnar confronts them there, now knowing full well who Korrallan is.  
- He demands that Sharam records and any Codex-related clues fall under Emberborn control.  
- Vanya, without ever naming the Consortium, insists on preserving and studying the material, refusing cult hoarding and state burying.  
- Korrallan insists the dead’s stories must pass into open record, not vanish into secret factions.  
- The standoff resolves with:  
  - Grimnar walking away with partial information and deepened personal resentment.  
  - Korrallan and Vanya aligned around witness, though their motives diverge more than he knows.  
  - Sharam names ready to be carried toward the Roadmarker.

# Chapter: Make A Mark

## Scene14-Heights Of Time ZyxDrapip’s Court
- The party climbs to ZyxDrapip’s palace; first direct, non-hostile conversation with a dragon.  
- History of Aria’s diplomacy and dragons reveals how Bravone / Emberborn-style bargains fit into a much older pattern.  
- Puzzle to claim Aria’s Diplomatic Sword: the group either succeeds now or leaves with an obligation to return; in any case, ZyxDrapip sends them on toward the Roadmarker and SylEshis.  

## Scene15-Approaching Destiny
- The Roadmarker rises on the horizon; pilgrims, weather, and campfires give weight to the moment.  
- Sharam names and stories are on the party’s tongues as they prepare for Korrallan’s inscription.  

## Scene16-By A Miner’s Stroke
- At the Roadmarker of Sundering, Korrallan carves his sigil into the Sundering Stone, using his miner’s tools and skill.  
- He may also inscribe the Sharam victims’ names, literally and metaphorically leaving a “deeper mark” than anyone expected.  
- The act subtly resonates—time and reality feel strained for a moment—hinting at the stone’s multiverse significance.

# Chapter: All the Time in the Worlds

## Scene17-Never Greet Yourself
- The party travels to SylEshis’ domain; along the way they glimpse alternate selves and warped time, setting an uncanny tone.  

## Scene18-Threshold Of All Time
- SylEshis reveals the worldtracks: Korrallan sees multiple versions of himself succeeding and failing, and understands his role is not just personal redemption but a pivot in Orbis history.  
- Crucially, SylEshis shows repeated visions of Durnek Bravone’s assassination at the Grand Masquerade across many timelines, framing it as a node that demands intervention.  
- Book 1 ends on this image: Korrallan, newly marked at the Roadmarker, staring into the knowledge that his father is fated to die in most futures, with everything about Durnek, Grimnar, Vanya, and the Bravone legacy now hanging over the question of whether he can change that.
