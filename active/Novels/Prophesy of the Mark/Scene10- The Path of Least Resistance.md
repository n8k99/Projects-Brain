title: Scene10- The Path of Least Resistance

# 10
The next morning the Dragon's Breathe did not cloud the peaks of the glacier opposite them, however the view of the path they had run up the previous day unfolded a vista which if they peered at the right spot on the northern horizon offered a glimpse of the glacier on which the Roadmarker of Sundering was perched. If they had better vision or optical instruments which would enhance their vision, they might have been able to make out the black stone monument dotting the central flat of the glacier. As it was, the path downhill from the Den of Ghesh-Balor was decidedly easier than their climb up to it. Especially as this time they were not being chased by a gang of kobold bandits. 

"You did say that it would take them a few days to figure out that they outnumbered us, so why are we leaving so soon?" Lyra questioned Vanya as they made their way through the decideduous forest lining the mountainside, "it seemed like we had much more to figure out about this place."

"It will be a few days before the kobolds get brave enough to come back, but we don't want to be here when they do." Vanya was plainly working out her argument as she navigated the pathway, "What we learned about Ghesh-Balor was very interesting and will be quite valuable information when we get someplace that we can trade it. But the most important thing we learned about the Dragonborn Warlord was that he raided other older ruins for a great deal of his initial wealth

"Who will pay gold pieces for information?" Aethel was slightly incredulous at this news.

"You would be surprised at how much platinum the right buyer will pay just to know what we have discovered." The green clad human lit up a very convincing smile as she replied. In fact, that copper ingot that Korralan is carrying is going to be worth quite a bit more because it is stamped with the name of an ancient trade group which no longer exists. Aethel's head bounced between her face and the dwarf who was plodding behind of every one. He was quite laden with a large metal slab on his back, but his strength was such that he did not seem to notice its weight.

"There, where the river begins to divert away from the road, is where the maps showed we should go." Vanya gestured. Lyra spotted a path that seemed to be in the brush and left the road. The whole party followed along as they traversed through the cold tundra. Having left the road, there were more rocks and brush to avoid so the path was harder to travel. Aethel keep looking back behind them, the expression on his face appeared the he was not too pleased to be off the beaten track and into the brush. Each time they got further and further away from the road, his expression grew more and more concerned.

"Are you okay?" Lyra had noticed his concerns and eased up next to him to gently check.

"yeah, I am fine, It's just," Aethel kept moving forward, following behind Vanya who had now taken the lead, 'Its just, well, I keep thinking I see someone behind us.'

"You mean other than our chatty social member?" Lyra lightly joked in a way that was only for the benefit of her brother's ease. Korralan was actually starting to fall further behind. 

"Yeah, other than him." Aethel grimaced, "It's like a dark shape that pops in and out of view every so often." This time when he glanced behind him, Korralan had stopped in his tracks and was just standing in between two bushes. He set down the metal ingot and freed his axe. Aethel then began to walk toward the dwarf, resting his hand on the hilt of his newly acquired sword. 

"Vanya," Lyra hissed, and when she caught the eye of the other woman, gestured with her head at the men. Vanya heaved a big sigh and turned back towards them as well. Before she and Lyra had gotten within fifteen feet of the other pair, a stout and weathered dwarf wearing a blackened leather cloak over tattered red and ash-grey robes stepped out from behind one of the small trees further away. 

"There's no need for that sort of greeting, Friends" his guttural voice scratchd and cracked the way molten lava pops when it is plunged into the sea. "I saw you lot leave the Infernal Route and thought I would catch you sooner. Name is Grimnar. 

"Hallo Grimnar," Aethel as ever was cheery when greeting a stranger, as his experience thus far had only taught him that he was only moments away from singing them a song and gaining several of their coins. 

"What can we do you for you stranger?" Vanya's voice was more defensive and restrained. "as you note, we are off the road, and you have come this far."

"That's right. I am a simple cleric on what you might call a holy mission." the dark dwarf unfolded his hands and spread them out before him in what seemed to be a peaceful gesture of openness. Korralan just stared at his face, watching closely every muscle movement, the way the coal-black beard with its intricate ember-orange streak patterns moved with his chin. Th former miner's grip tightened on his axe handle, however the mysterious cleric was completely unperturbed. "I am visiting all the old ruins, of which there are many in this valley, and even dragon lairs, seeking a lost relic of my order."

"What sort of relic?" Lyra was watching the way that Vanya moved carefully forward as she entered a demeanor of measured negotiation. 

"It is a sacred book describing the true history of this valley, written in several different languages, Dwarf, Elf, and Draconic " Grimnar's eyes grew intense and unwavering as he spoke. "It is my greatest desire to retrieve it so that we may further spread the word of truth about the world."

"There are many words for truth, not all of them are to be believed" Korralan seemed to have taken the final measure of the stranger and come to a decision for the whole party. "We are not really interested in more deceptions."

The expression on Grimnar's face flashed dark and dangerous for a moment and then returned to his peaceful still presentation. "I apologize for interfering in your business. I shall not delay you further. However, I do wonder if you know of the location of any dragon lairs?"

"I am sure if you have been out here for a while you know of the Bronze wyrmling who has moved into the the Palace of Aria on the Infernal Route just before you reach the Roadmarker of Sundering." Vanya tossing  this information out like a lure.

"Indeed. Many thanks. May the road and the winds be in your favor, and may the cleansing fires find you worthy" The cleric then turned and began to move back towards the road once again. The whole party stood silently and still and watched him recieded into the distance, this time he seemed to be making it very obvious that he was choosing to be seen while he made his exit from their company. No one spoke until he had had been gone a quarter of an hour.

"So that was spooky." Lyra practically whispered, breaking their silence vigil.

"Emberborn" Korralan drily gruntd. The other three looked at him in surprise and anticipation that more might come forth from his lips. When there was nothing more he was going to say, Aethel chimed in, "Do you want to let the rest of us know what that means?"

Korralan looked at him with a stone expression that was unreadable, "They are a dragon cult."

"Even though we have been in that little village on a glacier our whole lives, both my brother and I have seen lots of dragons. How is a dragon cult such a bad thing? There are lots of weird things folk will worship and chase and believe" Lyra was sincerely curious and there was an air about her that invited only genuine responses.

"The Dominion is rift with cults who believe that dragons are gods, they serve them first and foremost and it weakens dwarf culture." Korralan stowed his axe, picked up the metal ingot and once again began to trod on towards their destination.
