# 3
The Mine Bell’s echo died against the glacier walls, and Overseer Durni Trueblood stood staring at the Grand Mine doors as they rumbled shut. The deep‑mine troops’ bootfalls dwindled into the shaft, swallowed once more by Zhulmar’s depths. Only when the locks clanked back into place did his mind truly catch up with what had just happened.

There would be a report. That deep‑mine captain would commit everything to parchment—the Ember Trial invoked, the Bravone name, the Overseer’s fumbling—then send it down the chain to the Ruby Circle. Somewhere in the Dominion’s under‑halls, a clerk would copy the words neatly into some volume labeled “Hatfield – Surface Management,” and years from now another ambitious dwarf would read about Durni Trueblood and smirk. He could almost hear the quills already.

How was he supposed to know that dwarves really took the Ember Trial? The rite lived in bedtime tales, in the old story‑scrolls Flamewardens read to children about Soulcrushers who could no longer bear their lords’ orders and chose exile under the open sky. The tales always ended with one of two morals: the fool who died nameless on the surface, or the hero who stumbled into some ancient hoard, some new alloy or rune, and sent it back down to strengthen the Dominion. Both endings carried the same warning—follow leaders, not your own pride. In either telling, the Ember Trial was a lesson, not a form one could actually file with the Ruby Circle.

But someone had filed it. Durnek Bravone himself, if the captain’s phrasing was to be believed. A Forgemaster of a line old enough to have hammered weapons for the War of Ash and Iron had petitioned to cast his own son up here, and the Ruby Circle had signed. What sort of Bravone thought Zhulmar needed to change now, after thousands of years of carefully layered stone and law?

The doors thudded closed. Durni tore his gaze away and turned back toward the square. The path the exile had cut through the crowd had already filled in behind him. Hatfield dwarves who, this morning, had made sure to step out of his way wherever he walked now jostled his shoulders without apology as he tried to push through. His temper, already hot, flared. These insignificant surface folk were supposed to be stepping stones on his path back down to proper halls, not an audience for some deep‑mine spectacle that casually inverted the power of his little domain.

He elbowed forward, scowling, until he reached the open space where the “prisoner”—no, he corrected bitterly, the Ember‑Tried—had stood a moment ago. The center of the square was no longer empty. There, in a loose ring, stood Brother Ralilion Loody in his Ember‑spirit vestments, Caravan Master Rimthalien Aloevan with his travel‑creased cloak and easy smirk, the elf twins from Hatfield, and that human woman in green leathers from the caravan whose presence had already begun to bother him.

“So what is going on here?” Durni demanded, his voice scraping through the air as he stepped into the circle.

Brother Loody turned with infuriating calm, Ember‑comet symbol glinting faintly at his throat. “Ah, Overseer Trueblood,” he said. “Caravan Master Aloevan was just expressing his gratitude that this dwarf has volunteered to deal with the kobold gang along the Infernal Route. Which, I am sure, the Local Watch will greatly appreciate. It will spare you to attend to your more important duties here in Hatfield.”

Rimthalien did not bother to soften his expression. “From my perspective,” he said, “it sounds like the watch is long overdue in dealing with it. Smaller caravans than mine will stop risking the climb if the Infernal Route’s first Zhulmar outpost cannot keep the road clear. Your village exists because the Dominion wants a foothold up here, Overseer. No caravans, no coin, no reason for the Forge King to care whether Hatfield clings to this ice.”

He smiled, not kindly. “That said, I admit I will miss Mistress Sol’s informed company. She has been very useful on the north leg—identifying ruins, reading old stone. But she has been all but vibrating for an excuse to spend a season or three digging through High Nook Valley instead of being stuck in a trade train. Consider it a mercy, perhaps, that your exile has given her one.”

The woman in green—Vanya Sol, Durni remembered now—tilted her head, mouth curling as if she wanted to laugh and had decided against it. Her leathers and gear were traveler’s practical, but Seldiesal’s earlier comment had been right: there was a scholar’s eye behind them, the kind that saw value in old foundations the way dwarves saw value in ore.

For some reason, this nettled Durni more than the threat about caravans. Everyone was talking as if decisions had already been made without him. He drew breath to snap back—at Loody, at the caravan master, at anyone—when Aethel Sol‑astra, all long limbs and unearned poise, opened his mouth.

“I have been itching to see the Roadmarker of Sundering for some time,” the young elf said. “It is supposedly a magnificent monument, carved in the first days the Dominion acknowledged the steppes. They say Soulcrusher names there are older than some Towers.”

There was a note in his voice Durni despised. The miners might think the elf’s dramatics were hilarious, but Durni, who had clawed his way up from Ironhaven clan’s lower ledgers, heard only condescension. Aethel spoke as if the dwarves of Hatfield were provincial props in his personal saga.

“And what is your reason for being here?” Durni snapped, jabbing a thick finger toward Lyra, her twin. “What do you think you will be able to do?”

“I would watch my tone with my daughter, Overseer Trueblood,” Seldiesal said, stepping into the circle. Her hand pressed a satchel into Lyra’s grasp with firm finality. “They are both more than capable of taking care of themselves. If they have decided now is the time to set out on a little adventure, they have my blessing.”

The word adventure made Durni’s jaw clench. “That’s just wonderful,” he managed. “Down to only two healers in Hatfield. Who will watch the miners while she traipses after an Ember‑Tried exile and some caravan scholar?”

Brother Loody chuckled, the sound low and irritating. “Perhaps if you were more concerned with the miners’ well‑being,” he said, “you would give them a proper rest day once in a while instead of flogging them to break rock for your quotas night and day. But I am only one of the healers who has to put them back together when they break. So what do I know?”

Durni’s ears burned. The Flamewatcher’s digs always wrapped themselves in piety, but they landed just the same as any miner’s muttered curse. He opened his mouth, closed it, opened it again, words tangling.

While they snapped at each other, the exile had turned his attention elsewhere. Korrallan—Durni finally let the name surface, sour on his tongue—shifted his gaze away from the Overseer and focused on the woman in green.

“You said you know where the Roadmarker of Sundering stands,” he said.

“Of course.” Vanya’s answer was matter‑of‑fact. “We passed it coming up from the steppes. It is the first major marker on the Infernal Route where the Dominion’s claim is carved in obsidian, facing the Etrivalian banners. You could see the old Soulcrusher sigils under the newer Ruby Circle inscriptions if you knew what you were looking at.”

Her eyes flicked briefly toward Lyra, as if gauging whether the wizard‑to‑be would catch the implication about layered histories and contested narratives.

“Two weeks after that we passed the Cliff of Sorrows and crossed the Rarhoci,” she continued. “That is where the bandits began to probe us. Kobolds mostly, but someone is organizing them. They hit at night, tested our defenses, then faded back toward the old Den of Ghesh‑Balor whenever we pressed too hard.”

“If we had not been well‑armed,” Rimthalien added, “they would have done more than probe. We lost time, guards, and mules as it was. Again, Overseer, I have to stress: traders talk. Word that Hatfield allows bandits to nest this close will travel faster than my wagons.”

“I had no idea,” Durni protested. “If someone had informed—”

“What I am sure Overseer Trueblood means,” Brother Loody said smoothly, “is that these bandits have been quite elusive. Any patrols he sent would have been cleverly avoided.” His tone scattered a little sugar across Durni’s attempted defense, turning it into something that might sound reasonable to onlookers while still slipping a barb under the Overseer’s skin.

Korrallan let the quarrel go on one heartbeat longer, then cut through it.

“So,” he said, looking back to Vanya. “You know the way.”

She nodded once. The gesture was enough.

“Then let’s go.”

He turned and began walking toward the western edge of town, toward the track that led down into High Nook Valley and, eventually, the Roadmarker’s black silhouette on the horizon. No fanfare, no further words. Just a dwarf who had cut himself loose from the Dominion’s stone now stepping onto the surface roads that bound the rest of Orbis together.

It was as if gravity shifted. The ring of people around him broke apart, and Vanya stepped into his wake without hesitation. Aethel and Lyra followed, side by side, their earlier bravado now tempered by the weight of packs and the reality of the road. The path they formed across the square was narrow but clear.

Durni found himself suddenly, absurdly, in the middle of an empty space where authority should have been. Caravan Master Aloevan and Brother Loody drifted away in a different direction, their conversation already turning toward the Temple of the Comet and what reports they would send, what sermons they would shape from this day. Seldiesal did not look at him at all. She stood with Rielan at the edge of the crowd, watching their children go.

The square, which had felt like a stage for his role only an hour ago, now treated him as an afterthought.

Something in Seldiesal’s posture changed. Her eyes, which had been fixed on the departing trio, lost their ordinary focus. A faint glaze filmed them, the look Rielan knew meant she was stepping sideways in her perceptions, skimming threads of potential worldtracks. When she spoke, her voice carried an eerie stillness that made the nearest listeners straighten.

“You will leave a deeper mark on the Sundering Stone than you have imagined,” she said.

The words were not shouted. They did not need to be. They fell into the square like a stone into water, ripples spreading through dwarves and humans alike. No one could have said precisely whom she addressed. The sentence seemed to land on Korrallan’s shoulders as much as on the air itself, on the idea of the Roadmarker and what it might record.

Out on the edge of town, Korrallan paused mid‑stride. It was only for a heartbeat, barely long enough for anyone to notice unless they had been watching him closely. Then he shifted his pack, squared his shoulders, and walked on.

Seldiesal’s eyes cleared. She blinked once, as if coming back from a long moment held between breaths, then turned to Rielan. Together they angled toward the tavern, where traders were already beginning to drift for warmth and rumor. There would be questions about the Ember Trial and the Bravone name, and she would answer what she could while carefully omitting the glimpses she had just been given of obsidian stone, carved sigils, and the way a single new mark might tug at the web of Orbis’ history.

Alone now in the rapidly thinning crowd, Durni Trueblood stood in the middle of the square and realized that the day’s spectacle had moved on without him. The caravaners returned to their wagons, calculating delays and profits. Miners filtered back toward homes and side entrances, casting backward glances along the path the exile had taken. The great Mine Bell hung silent overhead, its work done for now.

He tugged his robe straight, as if the gesture might restore dignity the morning had eroded, and trudged back toward the Watch House. Behind his stiff back, Hatfield began quietly reshaping its stories. Somewhere deep below, in the Dominion’s stone, a clerk dipped a quill and began a new line in a ledger about an Ember Trial and an exile named Bravone.
