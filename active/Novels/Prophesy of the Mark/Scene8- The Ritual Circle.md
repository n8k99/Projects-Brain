Korralan stormed into the passageway full of determination leaving Vanya and Lyra to scurry along behind him. When the dark tunnel turned to the right, he somewhat recklessly marched onwards. Then passed a large door to the left but ignored it.

"Hey! Aren't you going to check in here?" Vanya had stopped at the door and began to examine it, because the hallway they were in now no longer had a light source, she had to take a moment to light her bullseye lantern. 

"No I am not going to explore every little room we come across. We have a real situation on own hands here." The dwarf whipped around to face the taller human, shaking his axe at her menacingly. Lyra hide behind Vanya's body and peered around to look at Korralan. "We have been chased into a dead end by a gang of kobolds who do not seem like they want to be friends with us, and until we solve this problem we are not safe to have your little ruins reading class."

Vanya settled her face and then deliberately put her book away. Taking care to insure that the ink bottle was properly stoppered. She then drew her rapier into her right hand. "You are correct. There is a more immediate problem, but I have a solution."

"That is good to hear," Korralan gruffly retorted. "Let us hear your solution." 

Just in that moment, Aethel caught up with the party in the passageway. "Hey there you are, look I think most of the bandits are in this place, they will catch us if we don't get out of here." Looked at him and gestured for him to keep quiet. "Oh, ok, so they are going to find us if we are not careful" He murmured much more quietly.

"These kobolds, like most of their kind, rarely ever form a group as large as this one without a leader imposing fear upon them." the green clad human began to unfurl her latest cognition results, "so we find the leader and make a big spectacular end to him in front of them and they will all flee in fear, which will give us enough time to get out of here before they realize that the numbers don't add up."

Korralan paused for a moment to consider this suggestion, "It seems like it could work, I guess this all depends on finding the leader soon, or else we are going to be slaughtered."

Aethel interjected, "I can hear them coming through that pretty armory, so we need to move soon." And with that Korralan turned and began to run deeper into the hallway, leaving everyone behind to realize that they needed to move with him. 

Vayna's lantern bounced as she sprinted after the dwarf. The twins, both were light on their feet yet they still made a slap pattern as their boots struck the stone floor beneath them. Suddenly the passage opened up into a large chamber. There was a fire roaring on the floor and five kobolds were lounging about eating and drinking. A shout from back in the room alerted the resting bandits, who then sprang to their feet and began to free their weapons. In an instance, Korralan was upon them, slashing and hacking with his axe. His first blow carried all the momentum of his running and laid out the bandit completely. Putting his foot on the kobold's thin lizard-like chest to put his blade out of its torso, left his back exposed to another bandit's effort. However, Aethel managed to deflect that attack by swinging his new sword like a club into the attacker's waist. Immediately realizing that the sword was still sheathed, he quickly freed the blade so that the steel shone brightly in the fire light. 

Another kobold approached Korralan from his left, swung its sword at him but because he could see the blow coming, the dwarf managed to dodge the blade as his axe came free from his first victim. Lyra stepped between Korrallan and her brother hefting her quarterstaff with both hand and brought it crashing down on a fourth advancing foe's head. Her strength was not sufficient to knock him out but it did cause the grey green creature to pause momentarily before it made further advancement. The last kobold began to slink around its comrades looking for an angle to attack the trio clustered next to the fire. It was shouting and yelling for others to find them quickly, and there was an immediate roared response from the passageway. The sounds of scurrying foes rushing headlong into the room, screaming and cursing was deafenening.

His axe finding a new home in the bandit's skull who came at him from the left, Korralan grunted with the effort and roared. While Aethel's blade now free from its sheath, found itself embedded in the hips of the foe in front of him. Lyra's opponent shook its head an stepped towards her, and before it could thrust its sword at her, she waved her right hand in a smooth gesture, then latched onto the kobold's sword arm while uttering "Panya íta!" Lightning flew from her fingertips and surged through the bandit's chain mail. The shocking grasp jolted the creature severely and it fell away from her, dropping its sword and hit its head on the ground rendering it unconscious. She turned to face the way they had come, where the rushing mass of the ambush force was entering the circle of firelight. 

A roar from deeper in the room, caused the party to turn their heads at once. The kobolds all froze in their tracks as an orc stepped into the circle of firelight. At his throat was a dagger in the hands of Vanya Sol, whose eyes danced about the room taking inventory of the situation. "Now it seems I have everybody's attention." She loudly proclaimed, and then ruthlessly sliced the orc's throat cutting through the veins in its neck. Its hands grasping the wound as he sunk down to his knees and Vanya's dagger bit into his back in multiple successive strikes causing him to topple face forward onto the stone floor. His blood seeping out in a torrent. This caused immediate pandemonium within the gang as they stampeded over themselves in fear. 

Korralan briefly gave chase, cutting down several more gang members but their fear drove them all to move so much faster than he could keep up, so he returned to the chamber. Vanya had just finished cleaning off her blade and slide it back into its hiding spot, "Do you think our problem has been solved?" She calmed asked.

"Aye," the dwarf responded, "for now."

"in that case, I have some work to get done here" She handed her bullseye lantern to Lyra to hold, and pulled out her book and quill. "There seems to be a key made of silver in the center of this dais. Shine that light over here." Lyra held the lantern up higher and illuminated the raised floor which seemed to dominate the center of the chamber.

Aethel was searching around the fire for where he had tossed the scabbard for his new sword, "What do you mean, you have some work to do? Shouldn't we be getting out of here before they come back?"

"Oh Darling," Vanya's voice was icy, "Those lizard brains will run in fear for a whole day before half of them realize that there were more of them than us. And then it will take them another day to get everyone else to see it, then they will fight for another day before they manage to get someone to lead them back here. And even then, most of them will peel away in the night and find someplace easier to prey."

"If that is the case why did the caravan leader made such a big deal of them to Overseer Trueblood?" The bard had found the sheath and was working out how to get the blade back into without slicing his own fingers in the process. 

"Because Rimthalien Aloevan is very good at his job." Vanya was making a copy of the marks on the ground that surrounded the edge of the dais, "that was a negotiation position, he was trying to get better rates for his people to stay in the village and by making it seem like there was a real danger that we had faced, maybe even get to trade at premium markup. These letters look like draconic, can you read them?" She nudged Lyra with her elbow.

"Oh wow" it just dawned on Lyra that she had no idea how the world outside of Hatfield worked and the scales began to fall from her eyes and then another realization that she had been asked a question, "Um, what? No, they look very, very old, not like what I was taught. Oh wait, I have an idea." She set the lantern on the dais, then put her hands together, opened them up like a book and said, "**Hanya i lammi.**" Then she placed her hands on the raised stone platform, looked at the words for a minute, "*Before the Great Fire comes, the peaks shall know a thousand kings.* I think it is a ward of some sort. But what are those lines of copper for?"
 
Korralan pointed at Athel, "Don't put that away, you and I are going to go make sure the rest of this place is empty."
