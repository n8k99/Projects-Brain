# 9
"Is that blood" Aethel exclaimed. He was pointing at the top of the southern wall of the chamber they had entered. There was a faded mural depicting scenes of warfare in the mountains. In a very grandiose manner there were armies within snow-capped peaks. In the air above them, red, blue and white dragons were depicted hovering,  swooping, and even spitting fire at the conflicts below them. One panel showed dwarfs and humans dressed in similar liveried armor, fighting a common foe. At the very top, obviously not part of the original artist's vision were the words Aethel was pointing at. Large scrawled letters which spelled out, "UNCOVER YOUR TEARS."

"Looks like it," Korralan assessed, "Also looks like this picture is of a really old battle."

"Why do you say that?" Aethel was curious to know, and also a little encouraged that the taciturn dwarf was deciding to speech with him instead of just marching through this little exercise of clearing the rooms.

"The way the armor is hanging on these dwarfs," he pointed with the head of his axe at a particularly large figure in the foreground of the painting. "We haven't constructed armor like that in five or six centuries."

"So, I guess I mean, how do you know that? I mean what makes you such an expert on armor," Aethel tentatively posed his question, "I am just curious."

Korralan, leveled his eye at the young elf, "Before I was a Soulcrusher, I had to make arms and armor. I had to grind out the edges of swords and axes, I had to learn the ways of our smiths so that I could correct those who were not doing it properly. This means I had to study all the techniques of history and know why we adapted our methods because sometimes there is a smith who is overly curious about these things and wants to do things a different way."

"Oh." was all that the bard could respond with.

"I also had to learn about things like these symbols here," Korralan gestured at several different sigils scattered about the room, "and be able to know that these are for old gods with names like Belenus, Apep, Oghma, and Ares."

"I know those names, there are tales we tell and sing about them," almost instinctively his hand drifted towards his lute, but because he was still carrying the unsheathed new sword, he seemed to realize that this was not a moment of invitation to sing, so he half-heartedly added  "I'll play some later."

Satisfied that there were no bandits left hiding in this chamber, Korralan returned to the passageway, with Aethel sticking right behind him. The passed through  the Hall of Broken Blades, and once again Aethel's eyes keep drifting to the tarnished silver chalice. It gave him an awful sense of foreboding that it was something really ghoulish and disturbed his mind every time he glanced at it, but could not keep himself from doing so. Yt he gestured in that direction. "So i looked at that tablet earlier, it mentions a sepulcher for a knight where the three valleys converge."

"You sound like the human woman." Korralan rumbled.

"What do you mean?" Aethel innocently quipped.

"So fascinated with the ancient past, when we have real problems in the now." The dwarf explained.

"Oh, right, I just thought, you'd be interested to know." As they reached the door that they had entered the stronghold, the dwarf set about to lift it back into place, to at least cover most of the hole but it was too damaged and finished splintering into pieces as he lifted it off the ground. With obvious frustration, the dwarf threw the shard which had fallng off in his hand through the doorway where it spun and clattered along the stones.

Then he picked up his axe and heading deeper into the passageway beyond the door. Once again, leaving Aethel standing there scratching his head in amazement. "So why did you leave the mines?" the elf lobbing the question at the receding dwarf's back as he started after him. "Was it because everything was falling apart around you down there?"

"No" Korallan grunted when the elf caught up to him, "Everything was not falling apart around me, but we weren't making anything any more."

"You mean the smiths were all crushed out?" Intentionally goading the dwarf a bit, Aethel was trying to get more out of him than grunts and groans. To their left a set of stairs descended and to their right the hall way turned once again. Heading down the stairs, Korallan began to explain, "The Smith working just fine, the mines were working just fine, my father was trying to get himself more political power with the" pausing at the bottom of the stairs as there was now a door to their right which was the only place that this was going. Korralan shouldered it open and strode into the chamber with his axe at the ready.

The room was obviously were soldiers had eaten meals and gathered their arms. There were empty racks for weapons lining two of the walls, vast storage jars sealed by the Iron Valley Consortium line one of the other walls. There was however no one alive in the vast room and the dwarf quickly turned on his heel and headed back up the stairs. 

"With the who?" Aethel peppered him further. But Korralan ignored him heading quickly through the hallway. There was a light up ahead that was not part of the stronghold, and this gave both of them a charge of energy as they prepared for the worst. The reached a door in the left wall where the light was pouring out, and rush in. 

Vanya was poking her dagger at a kobold which was stumbling away from her, while Lyra was taking turns battering two different bandits on their lizard like heads. A fourth one was trying to flee deeper into the room where a great stone table was on a raised platform. There were faded banners hanging along all the walls but Korralan did not pause to look at the room around him, instead he went into action. Fiercely chopping and hacking with his axe the small lizard folks were swiftly dealt mighty death blows. The whirlwind of motion that the dwarf exhibited was anything but civilized; pure barbaric power overcoming the problem with a solution based entirely in steel and muscle.  

"We could have interviewed them" Vanya actually was refraining herself from laughter. 

"And what would we find out from them?" Aethel asked. 

Lyra huffed, "Anything. We could have found out anything but now we have to do all the work ourselves."

Reaching under neath the table from where he stood next to the platform, Korralan picked up a piece of parchment, moved to wipe his axe off with it but glanced at what was on it first, then he paused. Then handing it out to Vanya, "Do you think they would have told you what this is for?"

Vanya took the proffered parchment scrap and studied it for a minute before speaking, "No I don't think that they would have any idea what the Dusk Court is."

"Neither do we." Aethel offered.

"I have heard plenty of rumors in this valley of a place older than this one, wait what is that?" She pointed under the table at a scroll case sealed on both ends with wax. Lyra scrambled up on the platform, scooped it up and cracked one end and out tumbled a roll of parchment leaves. As she went to spread them out on the stone table, she noticed that there were deep scratches on its surface that all seemed to make up a map. "There's a map up here."

They all gathered and Vanya traced out the river's path from the Infernal Road up to a marked stronghold on the table's surface. Then holding the fragment in her hand next to it. "I believe we now know exactly where the Dusk Court is located. And it is on our way towards the Roadmarker."
