# 5
The grey light of High Nook’s morning lay over the valley like a thin blanket that had forgotten how to warm. Rocks and scrubby bushes stood out as dark interruptions against the muted browns and whites, nature’s rough punctuation in a landscape that otherwise blurred into sameness. For a few breaths, the world held its quiet. Then a single bird, braver or more impatient than the rest, gave a tentative call.

In the space between that note and its echo, a dozen more voices joined. In moments, the entire taiga rang with birdsong, a cacophony layered over the distant murmur of the Rarhoci. The sound tugged at the elves’ awareness like a hand. Lyra and Aethel, seated back‑to‑back with their legs folded beneath them, opened their eyes in unison. Their trance broke as cleanly as a snapped string.

Aethel, true to his nature, did not rise so much as spring. He reached for his lute almost before his feet found the ground, fingers testing each string with practiced plucks. The notes were not music meant for others; they formed a private pattern, an exercise to wake the instrument and his hands together. Scales slipped into arpeggios, his fingers stretching, crossing, and uncrossing as muscle and memory aligned. It was a ritual as much as any prayer, one he had performed every morning for years in Hatfield’s cramped rooms. Here, under open sky, the sound seemed to fly farther.

Lyra unfolded herself more gradually. She rolled her shoulders, then bent forward from the waist, fingertips reaching for her toes. Cold air bit at the back of her neck as her spine stretched; she exhaled warmth over her shins and felt blood return to limbs that had sat still for hours. From basic stretches, she flowed into more deliberate movements, each one matching breath to motion. Without thinking, her hands traced patterns in the air that mirrored the sigils she had been practicing in secret—little fragments of spell forms, tightened into stretches. If Aethel’s fingers were limbering for performance, her body was limbering for focus.

By the time they finished, both twins stood fully alert, the last haze of reverie burned away by cold and movement. They turned their attention to the more mundane ritual of the morning: coaxing last night’s fire from sullen coals into flame.

Vanya had not moved far during the night. She sat half‑hidden in the tangle of an evergreen rush bush, her dark green leathers blending into the scrub. From a distance, she could have been another shadow. Up close, one could see the small ledger balanced on her knees, the ink bottle cradled in a hollow between roots.

“That is quite the waking ritual,” she remarked as Lyra leaned over the tiny fire circle.

Lyra nearly dropped the small kettle of water she had been lowering onto the stones. “Oh! You startled me.”

“My apologies,” Vanya said. “That was not my intention.” Her voice carried its usual dry, measured cadence, as if every word had to pass through a scholar’s filter before it could be spoken. She corked her ink bottle, wiped her quill, and slid the notebook away with precise motions that suggested long practice.

“It must be nice not to sleep,” she added, watching the twins with a curiosity not unlike the way she regarded old ruins.

Aethel blew gently on the ember bank, coaxing a tongue of flame to lick up around a twig. “I do not know why we bother with this every time,” he said, side‑eyeing his sister. “You could just wave your hands and conjure a blaze fit for a tavern hearth.”

“Because making fire is a necessary skill,” Lyra replied automatically. “Relying on magic for basic things is lazy.” The exchange had the comfortable rhythm of something they had said to each other many mornings in Hatfield. She turned back to Vanya. “I do not know any other way of waking. It is how my whole life has been. Not that my life has been that long yet.”

“Fair enough,” Vanya said. “My observation comes from a body that insists on sleep, whether I wish it to or not.”

She stood, stretching until her joints popped, and turned to look east. The mountains loomed, their jagged line softened by a bank of low‑lying cloud that hugged the glacier’s shoulder. The rising sun behind them struggled to turn the grey mass into anything more cheerful than a lighter shade of the same.

“Do you think those clouds will clear?” she asked. “Or are we in for rain?”

“Father calls that Dragon’s Breath,” Aethel said, settling back on his haunches. The kettle lid rattled faintly as the first bubbles formed. “He says that this time of year, the glacier wakes up and exhales. The dwarves love that story. By midday, the sun will burn through it and leave us with a crisp sky.”

The three of them fell quiet while the water boiled. They drank weak tea and finished the remainder of last night’s stew straight from the pot, sharing the last thick mouthfuls without ceremony. As they ate, the valley’s morning sounds grew: the rush of the Rarhoci a little louder, the rustle of small things in the brush a bit bolder now that the fire’s smoke had thinned.

Cleaning and packing became its own small, wordless dance. Lyra rinsed and wiped the pot, Aethel tamped down the fire, Vanya checked straps and counted pouches by touch. She watched the twins’ faces while they worked, reading them as she might read a weather‑worn inscription—looking past the surface to what might be implied.

“You are suddenly questioning the wisdom of your decision,” she said, not quite making it a question.

Lyra paused, midway through shoving the wiped down pot into her pack, then nodded. She gestured at the narrow camp, at their packs, at the surrounding expanse. “We have very little in the way of supplies. No beasts, no spare boots, no oil for lamps. And we just… walked off the glacier into this.” Her hand took in the taiga, the hills, the horizon. “I wonder how we will manage.”

Aethel had been reaching for his lute. He plucked at a string without looking up, as if the problem did not quite attach to him. “We have enough,” he said. “We have wits, a dwarf, and a scholar of monuments. That’s practically luxury.”

“Travelling with a caravan is not luxury,” Vanya said. “It is simply suffering in company. This is no worse than the road between Akalaya and Dhodh‑La, just emptier. There is food to be had if you know where to look, and water ahead.”

Before Lyra could reply, Korrallan stepped back into the circle of their camp. He had gone off alone at dawn, vanishing into the shadows under the boulder where he had slept, and had returned without the slightest attempt at a stealthy approach.

“We need to move,” he said.

No embellishment. No explanation. He turned away from the rising sun and began to walk.

They had seen him like this already: the single‑minded focus of a dwarf who has chosen his next tunnel and will not waste breath discussing alternative routes. The trio scrambled to shoulder their packs. Aethel slung his lute across his back, muttered something about “proper marching songs being wasted on people who will not listen,” and kicked dirt over the last embers. Lyra checked that her spell components were accessible. Vanya made sure her blades were free in their sheaths.

They fell into a pattern as the morning lengthened. Korrallan walked alone, twenty or thirty paces ahead, his compact frame cutting a steady line through scrub and uneven ground. Behind him, Vanya and Lyra traded places as terrain dictated—Vanya taking the lead where the path narrowed and required quick choices, Lyra when the way was clearer and she could let her mind wander without tripping. Aethel drifted at the rear, occasionally speeding up to make a remark, then dropping back again to improvise a quiet melody.

By mid‑morning, the valley floor had pressed them closer to the Rarhoci. The river’s voice grew from background murmur to a constant presence, the rush of cold water over stone. The taiga thinned near its banks, trees giving way to gravel bars and bare rock. The ground underfoot tilted gently, drawing them toward the sound.

They crested a low rise, and the Infernal Route appeared: a broad, well‑worn track of packed earth and broken stone running roughly north–south. Wagons and boots had scored it with countless ruts. Here, where it met the Rarhoci, the road bent to cross the river via a stone bridge that arched gracefully from bank to bank, its parapets layered with old moss and newer scratches.

Korrallan halted at the foot of the bridge. He turned his head without quite looking back, as if confirming that the others were still behind him but unwilling to break his gaze from this first major mark of the wider world’s infrastructure.

“The Infernal Route,” Vanya said as she came up beside him. Her voice held a note that was half nostalgia, half professional appraisal. “North, it runs to Shrinqash and beyond, skirting the eastern towers that watch the Steppes. South, it will eventually take you back toward Akalaya and the Cliffs of Ashenreach.”

She pointed north along the line of the road. “That way lies the Roadmarker,” she said. Then she gestured south. “That way lies everything we just left. Kobolds included.”

Korrallan grunted, the sound ambiguous. Then he began to walk across the bridge.

The others kept pace this time. For a brief span they walked side by side, boots thudding on old stone, the Rarhoci’s cold spray rising faintly from below. Lyra glanced over the parapet, mesmerized by the water’s power; she had seen rivers in books, but Hatfield knew only melt channels and cisterns, not full‑throated flows like this.

“I was here only a few days ago,” Vanya said as they reached the far side. She swept a hand toward the left bank—the western side. “Over there was their last attempt on us. They came out of the brush in a wave.”

Lyra opened her mouth. “Were there many—”

The crash cut her off.

From the right side of the road, up‑valley, came the sharp report of something heavy striking stone. Every head turned. An old tree trunk, blackened and stripped of branches, burst into view as it rolled down a short, steep embankment. It had been propped on a ledge just out of sight; now, freed, it spun ponderously toward the road, shedding clods of dirt and small stones.

Behind it, a swarm of small shapes spilled down the slope like gravel.

Kobolds.

They were grayish‑green, their scales muddied to near uniformity by dust and grime. Some wore scraps of leather or chain, others only harnesses for blades and slings. Yellow eyes gleamed in narrow faces as they shrieked and whooped, voices high and harsh. The first rank had clearly planned to use the log as both battering ram and distraction; several misjudged their timing and went tumbling over it instead, sent sprawling by their own trap.

“Run!” Vanya snapped.

The log hit the road where the four companions had stood heartbeats earlier, bounced once, and rolled on, clipping the far parapet hard enough to knock loose a shower of stones. If they had hesitated, it would have taken their legs out from under them.

Korrallan’s axe was in his hands before Lyra’s shout had fully formed. Vanya had a dagger in each fist, blades catching what little light seeped through the Dragon’s Breath clouds. Lyra and Aethel were already moving, instincts honed on childhood dares and escapes from irate dwarven shopkeepers kicking in; they turned west, toward the slope and away from the open road, boots digging for purchase.

The four of them bolted uphill.

Behind them, the kobolds screamed—a ragged chorus of excitement and frustration. Stones from slings whistled past, thudding into dirt and biting into bark. Cruder missiles followed: sticks, broken bits of pottery, anything that could be hurled. A spear tip grazed Aethel’s cloak; another skittered off Korrallan’s shoulder pauldron, leaving a scratch in the metal but not the flesh beneath.

The hillside above the road was no gentle incline. It rose in a series of rough shelves, each one a tangle of brush, loose rock, and treacherous ground. Old goat paths and game trails crisscrossed it, none of them designed for sustained, panicked flight. The party scrambled, grabbed at roots, stumbled, clawed their way up.

Whenever one of the kobolds managed to close enough to swing a club or stab with a short spear, Korrallan wheeled. His greataxe, forged in Haas Bravone and sharpened only the day before his exile, rose and fell with brutal efficiency. In the constrained space of a narrow trail or between two rocks, his shorter frame was an advantage; he could brace his stance and let the enemy come to him.

One kobold lunged, teeth bared, club raised. Korrallan stepped into the blow, turned his shoulder, and brought the axe down in a clean, diagonal stroke. The kobold’s scream cut off as it crumpled, weapon tumbling from nerveless fingers. Another tried to leap past him toward Lyra; his backswing caught it in the ribs and sent it skidding back down the hill, wheezing.

More kobolds poured from hiding places around the bridge—behind boulders, from shallow pits they had dug in the embankments, from clever camouflaged burrows. The initial fourteen that had triggered the trap were quickly joined by more, their numbers swelling into a small mob. They knew the ground; they had clearly rehearsed this ambush.

“Keep moving!” Vanya shouted. She ran light, picking paths almost by instinct, her sense for terrain honed by weeks of scouting ahead of the caravan. Knives flickered at her sides, ready but not yet thrown; ammunition spent too early would be wasted.

Lyra’s breath burned in her chest. She was not unused to walking—Hatfield’s errands demanded plenty—but sprinting uphill under a pack while someone tried to put holes in her was new. A stone clipped her ear; heat flared, and fingers came away wet when she brushed the spot.

She stopped abruptly, planting her feet on a relatively flat patch. “Keep ahead of me,” she called to Aethel, who skidded to a halt beside her in confusion. “Just for a moment.”

“What are you—”

Lyra’s hands rose. Her fingers traced a tight, practiced pattern, the movements crisp despite the tremor of adrenaline. She pushed air through pursed lips, shaping the word that completed the sequence.

“Pilinnar.”

Three darts of force, bright as stars in the grey light, jerked into existence around her outstretched hand. They streaked down the slope with unerring accuracy, each seeking the heat of a kobold body. The nearest three pursuers staggered as invisible fists punched into their chests. One tumbled backward into its comrades, knocking two more off balance; another dropped its spear and clutched at its ribs, gasping; the third spun and fell, eyes wide with sudden, bewildered pain.

The effect on the rest was immediate. Fear rippled through the swarm. Kobolds were used to being the ambushers, the ones who exploited surprise and numbers. Being struck from afar by something they could not see or dodge prodded at deeper, older terrors—the kind associated with dragons’ breath and sorcerers’ curses.

“Nice,” Aethel breathed.

“Run,” Lyra said, voice a little hoarse.

They did.

The hillside pressed them into a funnel between two large rocks, a pinch point where centuries of erosion had left a narrow gap and a natural rise in the ground. Korrallan recognized the tactical value at a glance. He lunged into the choke, planting his boots on the higher ground, shoulders nearly touching the stone on either side. There, he could not be easily flanked.

He raised his greataxe and let out a short, wordless roar—a sound that came from somewhere deep in his chest, from the same place that had fueled war‑songs in the War of Ash and Iron. It was not magic, but it had an effect. The first kobold to reach the gap hesitated for a fraction of a heartbeat.

It was enough.

Steel met scaly skin. The narrowness of the passage kept them from swarming him in full numbers; they had to come in ones and twos, scrambling over the bodies of those who fell. Korrallan’s axe rose and fell, rose and fell, a metronome of violence. Each swing was measured, efficient. He did not waste movement. His breath came in harsh grunts, but his arms did not slow.

The kobolds, for their part, were not cowards. Desperation and whatever promises their unseen leader had made drove them forward. But as the pile at Korrallan’s feet grew, fewer were willing to be the first into the meat‑grinder. They clustered back down the slope, hurling stones and curses instead of their bodies.

“Come on!” Vanya shouted from higher up. She had stopped on a small shelf and turned, one hand pointing upward, the other busy with something at her feet. “There are more coming from the road.”

On cue, a distant horn sounded—a shrill, broken note repeated three times. Answering cries rose from farther south along the Infernal Route. The kobold gang was larger than the initial fourteen and the handful that had joined them. Much larger.

Korrallan slammed his axe down in a final, crunching blow that split a wooden shield and the arm behind it. The kobold shrieked and collapsed. He used the opening to disengage, planting his boot on the fallen body to push off. He turned and sprinted uphill toward Vanya.

“Stop!” she yelled.

He skidded, half from confusion, half from the treacherous footing. “Go, stop—make up your mind,” he growled.

“Step over this,” she said, gesturing sharply.

A nearly invisible line of twine stretched across the trail between two rocks at shin height. It led back through a series of smoother stones where she had looped it high, then onward to a thicker rope barely visible against the hillside.

Korrallan stepped high, clearing the line with room to spare. “What does it do?” he puffed.

“Up there,” Vanya said, nodding toward a precarious cluster of rocks lodged in a narrow gully above the choke point. “If we are lucky, the first fool to charge through will trip it and pull that brace loose. The rocks should come down right where you were standing. Even if it does not crush many, it will slow them and block the passage for a bit.”

Korrallan glanced back down the slope. From this vantage, he could see the narrow gap where he had made his stand, the pile of bodies, the scrambling kobolds. Beyond them, more gray‑green shapes moved among the rocks near the road, rushing to join the hunt.

“Perhaps it will buy us time,” he said. “We will need it.”

Vanya did not wait for agreement. She took off uphill again, knees lifting high to avoid loose stones, eyes already scanning for the next defensible feature. Korrallan followed, the twins just ahead now that the path had widened.

Behind them, a kobold screamed—a different pitch from the battle shouts, sharp and abruptly cut off. A heartbeat later, the grinding rumble of stone sliding over stone rolled up the hill, followed by panicked yelps.

Vanya allowed herself a tight, satisfied smile without slowing. “That is one,” she murmured. “We will see how many more the valley offers before we reach the Roadmarker.”
