title: Scene7- The Sealed Threshold

"Oh Sister, I am here to be your protector!" Aethel sing songed his voice as he entered the stronghold proper. A flick or two of his wrist made his rapier sing as well. Glancing about, then losing the expectant look on his face as he took in the atmosphere and decorations of the long chamber he found himself in. Obviously the room itself had been carved into the mountain by very extremely skilled stone cutters. The hall had obviously been used to display an impressive display of trophies and weapons and where many other vain rulers with expansive collections would have just pointed out a room in which to build cabinets and stands to host his precious items, the original inhabitant of this place pointed at a slab of mountain and told his stone cutters to build a room specifically for the job.  Cabinets and display cases were cut into the stone, carving out the place where swords, maces, spears, antiquated armor, shields all stood in an astonishing display of wealth and power. Nearly every item had some sort of copper accent, which lead Aethel to believe that whoever gave them to the collector had that piece created with his own very well-known aesthetic philosophy in mind. It was mind boggling all the different pieces in one place: dwarf axes, human swords, elvish blades, and these strangely beautiful and terrifying curved weapons from no land or cultures that Aethel had ever known existed.  

Everything had a layer of dust on it, but it all seemed perfectly preserved, except for a case in the middle of the floor which had been destroyed, and one of the long curved swords which must have been kept in it was partially buried in the pile of rubble on the floor. Aethel put his rapier back in its belt hook, squatted down at the pile of rubble, shifted a few large stones and freed the blade on the floor. "Well Overseer Trueblood will be having nightmares of rebellions and sending the watch out to inspect houses at all hours of the night if he finds out about such a well stocked armory just a day away." he pulled the blade partially out of the intricately designed sheath on which red dragons seemed to dance up and down it, and naturally from this collection there was inlaid copper highlights intricately incorporated into the design. Carefully laying his thumb on the edge of the weapon and then putting it in his mouth directly, "oh that is sharp!" Aethel exclaimed.

"Would you hurry up!" Lyra hissed at him from much further down the hall where the rest were at. Sucking his thumb the whole way to the far end of the hall, Vanya had her book out still and was taking copious notes while Korralan was wiping off his axe. At his feet were the dead bodies of three kobolds, they had been hacked into a bloody pile and there was a growing puddle of blood surrounding them. 

"So you're telling me that those dwarf axes predate the War of Ash and Iron?" Vanya had a look that she was in the midst of attending the most fascinating lecture she'd ever been in. And she was seemingly oblivious to the ichor flowing under her boots. 

"That's right, and while very few of these weapons were made by dwarfs, they are of the work of the highest crafts makers who had obviously studied with dwarf masters." Finishing wiping down his axe, he pointed at a cabinet behind them, "that case in particular"

Vayna quickly glanced up from her book to notice where he was pointing, "the one with the elf blades?"

"Exactly, but if you knew what I know, you could see how the traditional elf forging tcchniques were not used to craft these very traditional blades. Its plain in the way the edge is set on them, dwarf sharpening was used, which does not work on a traditionally tempered elf blade."

"Are you okay?" Lyra whispered to him. 

"What?" Aethel didn't take his thumb out of his mouth and then realized why she was asking him he removed it and looked at it, "oh this? This blade is very sharp." He held the long katana up as proof for her to see. "You don't think anyone will mind if I carry this around for a little while?"

"These kobolds have been using weapons from this armory, so you are probably fine to, um, borrow it for an indefinite period of time." Vanya smiled at him as she paused her note taking to answer him. Then with her quill she pointed at a point behind Aethel's head, "That banner up there, what period do you suppose it is from?"

Korralan lifted his had and stared at the broken banner hung above the large display case full of human plate armor and shields with various different heraldic devices painted or engraved into their surface. Some of which had both the fancy smith work and the brilliant enamel colors designating the origins of their owner. "That's your Kingdom of Three Peaks. A human kingdom that once controlled the surface. I think they are a couple centuries before we fought Ignarath."

Aethel followed her pointing as well, only he walked all the way over to the display and looked closely a tarnished silver chalice on a shelf. Next to it was a cracked stone tablet, waving Lyra over he pointed it out to her, and then drifted back towards Vanya and Korralan. 

"So pre-War of Ash and Iron?" the green clad human had once again bowed her head over her little book and was furiously writing down everything. Her brow wrinkled with the concentration, and her rapid movements between the ink bottle and page seemed to Aethel to be dangerously close to causing a massive splatter in any moment. 

"Yes. That's the right time" the dwarf nodded even as he affirmed her question. 

"Is this place all from that time period?" Again the pen scratched on the page and this time it echoed slightly in the hall as everything seemed to stand still for just a moment, and then Korralan began to walk about and examine the weapons a little more closely before he answered. "No this is, do we call it newer, that feels wrong because it is also older than the war." 

"So I sing a song about a kingdom that has been gone for centuries and it makes dwarfs happy?" Aethel took his thumb out of his mouth just to express how incredulous he was at this comment. "That is just preposterous!"

Korralan shot a dark look at the elfish bard and leveled his voice, "Dwarfs have long memories, never forget that boy." Then turning to Vayna he began to walk towards a passage that lead deeper into the mountain. "We need to keep moving, we are going to have visitors very soon and this is not where I want to face them."

"What I want to know is" Aethel began to mutter to himself, "what sort of training does it take to be a Soulcrusher and how does he know all this stuff?"

"Maybe if you ask him he'll tell you." Lyra lightly chided him as she passed.

"Oh yea like he'll answer me. I'm pretty sure he doesn't like me one bit." The elfish bard let himself slip into another sulk. "I bet if she asks, he'll tell her."

"Well she does seem pretty smart." Lyra chortled.

"I'd stop at pretty." her brother despondently whimpered. 

"Are you saying that he only talks to her because of how she looks, like some sort of barbarian!?!" Lyra mocked her surprise, "no wonder he doesn't like you!" And with that little stab, she flounced off after the other two party members once again leaving Aethel behind. He just turned around and faced the Hall of Broken Blades like it was an old friend who he might never see again and then backed hius way into the passageway.
