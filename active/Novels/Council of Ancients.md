## The Red Surge

The banishment of [[IgnarathTheScorchedTyrant]] following the [[War of ⚱️Ash and 🔨Iron]] (_GC+899_) was meant to diminish [[T.A.S.K.S. System Audit/Thirteen Towers/Dragons/02 Chromatic Alliances/ChromaticAlliances|Chromatic Alliances]] influence across [[Orbis]]. For nearly two centuries, this seemed to hold true as the Council of Ancients maintained relative stability with [[Aurenstraal The Dawnwing Ascendant]]'s [[T.A.S.K.S. System Audit/Thirteen Towers/Dragons/03 Metallic Guardians/Gold Dragon|gold dragons]]  serving as champions of justice throughout the continent.

But **Ignarath's** retreat to his lineage domain on [[Aerys]] was not defeat—it was strategic withdrawal. From exile on this distant megastructure—a spherical shell built around a star in another stellar system—the [[T.A.S.K.S. System Audit/Thirteen Towers/Dragons/02 Chromatic Alliances/ancient-red-dragon|Ancient Red Dragon]] spent centuries meticulously plotting his return to power. Despite being physically banished for the past 300 years, he maintains sophisticated magical communication with his followers through draconic telepathy, dream visitation, and specialized artifacts. From Aerys, he has cultivated a vast network of [[T.A.S.K.S. System Audit/Thirteen Towers/Dragons/02 Chromatic Alliances/Red Dragon]] loyalists, infiltrated key institutions across Orbis, and patiently waited for the perfect opportunity to reassert chromatic dominance.

That opportunity came when **Aurenstraal** stepped down from the Council in _GC+1099_ to pursue ascension beyond the material plane. With the [[T.A.S.K.S. System Audit/Thirteen Towers/Dragons/03 Metallic Guardians/Gold Dragon|gold dragons]] ' greatest protector gone, **Ignarath's** carefully orchestrated plan—centuries in the making—was finally set in motion.

The rise of this plan was fueled in part by rumour and fear: many in the chromatic leadership came to believe that certain gold-lineage ancients had been quietly sympathetic to, or even covertly cooperating with, the [[Luminarian Empire|Luminarian Empire]]—a polity suspected of hiding remnants of Na's forbidden technology. That perception cast the cautious golds as potential collaborators, giving Ignarath and his allies the pretext they used to justify a violent purge.

### The Extinction of the Gold Dragons

When [[Aurenstraal The Dawnwing Ascendant]] departed from the Council of Ancients to pursue ascension beyond the material plane, he left his [[T.A.S.K.S. System Audit/Thirteen Towers/Dragons/03 Metallic Guardians/Gold Dragon]] lineage without their ancient protector. What followed was one of the darkest chapters in the history of dragonkind on [[Orbis]].

[[IgnarathTheScorchedTyrant]], though banished from the Council, maintained a vast network of [[T.A.S.K.S. System Audit/Thirteen Towers/Dragons/02 Chromatic Alliances/Red Dragon]] loyalists. Seeing an opportunity in **Aurenstraal's** departure, **Ignarath** orchestrated a systematic purge of the [[T.A.S.K.S. System Audit/Thirteen Towers/Dragons/03 Metallic Guardians/Gold Dragon]] bloodlines. This genocidal campaign unfolded in three devastating phases:

1. **The Night of Molten Tears (GC+1167)** - Multiple coordinated attacks on gold dragon lairs across eastern Orbis, timed to coincide with a planetary conjunction that weakened the [[T.A.S.K.S. System Audit/Thirteen Towers/Dragons/03 Metallic Guardians/Gold Dragon|gold dragons]] ' divine connections. Dozens of [[T.A.S.K.S. System Audit/Thirteen Towers/Dragons/03 Metallic Guardians/adult-gold-dragon|adult gold dragons]] were slain in a single night.

2. **The Corruption of Vurmyzzeth (GC+1168-1170)** - [[VurmyzzethTheChronowraithSaint]], once _Aurenstraal's most promising heir_, was corrupted through arcane manipulation and necromantic rituals, transforming him into a [[T.A.S.K.S. System Audit/Thirteen Towers/Dragons/04 Exotic Element/Dracolich Dragon]]. In his twisted undead state, **Vurmyzzeth** betrayed the remaining [[T.A.S.K.S. System Audit/Thirteen Towers/Dragons/03 Metallic Guardians/Gold Dragon|gold dragons]] by revealing their hidden sanctuaries and secret refuges.

3. **The Final Hunt (GC+1171-1174)** - The remaining [[T.A.S.K.S. System Audit/Thirteen Towers/Dragons/03 Metallic Guardians/Gold Dragon|gold dragons]]  were hunted to extinction by a coalition of chromatic dragons led by Ignarath's lieutenants. Even their eggs were sought out and destroyed to prevent any possible resurgence.

The few [[10 PeopleDirectory/FactionsandPolitics/Knight of the Dawnblades]] who still maintain **Aurenstraal's temples** whisper that their patron sensed this betrayal but could not return from his ascension journey. Some believe that somewhere on [[Orbis]], _a single clutch of gold dragon eggs_ remains hidden, protected by powerful wards left by Aurenstraal before his departure.

### Current Balance of Power

The extinction of the [[T.A.S.K.S. System Audit/Thirteen Towers/Dragons/03 Metallic Guardians/Gold Dragon|gold dragons]]  has fundamentally altered the balance of draconic power on Orbis. With the champions of justice eliminated and the void left by **Aurenstraal** unfilled, the remaining metallic dragons have been forced into a defensive posture. [[VelthorynTheSilverSentinel]] and [[MaltherionArbiterOfDragonkind]] have spent decades searching for evidence of surviving [[T.A.S.K.S. System Audit/Thirteen Towers/Dragons/03 Metallic Guardians/Gold Dragon|gold dragons]] , but thus far have found nothing but ruins and remnants.

Meanwhile, chromatic influence—particularly that of red dragons—has surged across multiple regions. Though **Ignarath** himself remains in exile, his lineage now operates with unprecedented freedom and boldness. The **Council of Ancients**, diminished by **Aurenstraal's absence**, struggles to counterbalance this growing chromatic resurgence.

The [[10 PeopleDirectory/FactionsandPolitics/Knight of the Dawnblades|Knights of the Dawnblades]] continue to hold vigil at their ancient temples, awaiting a sign that the lineage of **Aurenstraal** might someday return to restore justice and light to a world increasingly dominated by the chromatic dragons' influence.

[[VelthorynTheSilverSentinel]] and [[MaltherionArbiterOfDragonkind]] have spent decades searching for evidence of surviving [[T.A.S.K.S. System Audit/Thirteen Towers/Dragons/03 Metallic Guardians/Gold Dragon|gold dragons]] , but thus far have found nothing but ruins and remnants. The absence of [[T.A.S.K.S. System Audit/Thirteen Towers/Dragons/03 Metallic Guardians/Gold Dragon|gold dragons]]  has created a critical imbalance in the draconic power structure of [[Orbis]], one that the remaining metallic dragons struggle to compensate for.

## Agendas for All

### Opposing Visions for Orbis

At the heart of the Council's current divide are two fundamentally opposing visions for the future of Orbis and its inhabitants, represented by two ancient dragons whose philosophies have shaped the Council's politics for millennia.

**[[IgnarathTheScorchedTyrant]]** seeks to return to Orbis by systematically eliminating any metallic dragons who would oppose his supremacy. His grand strategy is twofold:

1. **Trigger humanoid wars** across the continent that will:
   - Distract the metallic, gem, and exotic dragons who would otherwise unite against him
   - Set off a massive reduction in humanoid populations without requiring another direct dragon-led cull
   - Create power vacuums that his chromatic allies can exploit

2. **Restore chromatic dominance** by:
   - Continuing the systematic elimination of metallic dragons (as demonstrated by the gold dragon genocide)
   - Establishing chromatic dragons as the unquestioned rulers of their respective territories
   - Eventually returning from exile to claim his place as the supreme dragon of Orbis

In stark contrast, **[[VelthorynTheSilverSentinel]]** advocates for a fundamentally different relationship between dragons and humanoids. His vision is to:

1. **Empower humanoid civilizations** to:
   - Develop their full potential without draconic interference
   - Create societies based on justice, knowledge, and balance
   - Eventually become true partners with dragonkind rather than subjects or pawns

2. **Minimize draconic influence** by:
   - Limiting direct dragon intervention in humanoid affairs
   - Creating systems where dragons serve as advisors rather than rulers
   - Establishing boundaries between dragon territories and humanoid realms

### Council Alignments

The remaining Council members align themselves along this philosophical spectrum, with some firmly in one camp and others taking more nuanced positions:

#### Aligned with Ignarath's Vision
- **[[SylvrathTheRootfather]]** - Seeks to reclaim territories lost to humanoid expansion and restore primeval forests under chromatic control
- **[[VorthyxTheWardenOfStorms]]** - Desires to dominate coastal regions through strategic weather manipulation and naval warfare
- **[[Chemraza the Venombinder]]** - Works to corrupt political structures through subtle manipulation, creating fractured societies vulnerable to draconic rule
- **[[NymalgraMistressOfSolitude]]** - Maintains isolation of northern territories, believing dragons should rule absolutely in their domains

#### Aligned with Velthoryn's Vision
- **[[MaltherionArbiterOfDragonkind]]** - Upholds ancient laws and treaties between dragons and humanoids, serving as mediator and judge
- **[[Kaerinth Keeper Of Forgotten Truths]]** - Preserves knowledge and history for all species, believing shared wisdom leads to harmony

#### Complex/Neutral Positions
- **[[ZytharaDreamwalkerOfTheAmethystVeil]]** - Observes the conflict through visions and dreams, rarely taking direct action but offering cryptic guidance to both sides
- **[[Ithryzkal Mindvault Of The Sapphire Nexus]]** - Studies the psionic patterns of the conflict, believing the mental evolution of both dragons and humanoids should proceed without interference
- **[[Droskithar Devourer Of Leylines]]** - Concerned primarily with magical energies, intervenes only when the conflict threatens to destabilize Orbis' magical infrastructure
- **[[OrmyraMotherOfTides]]** - Remains largely neutral, focused on oceanic domains but growing increasingly concerned about how the conflict might affect aquatic realms

### The Broken Accord

The current escalation of tensions—manifesting in the events now known as "The Broken Accord"—represents the most direct implementation of Ignarath's strategy in centuries. By manipulating the [[Government Types/FactionsandPolitics/Consortium of whispers/Consortium of Whispers]] and other proxy organizations, Ignarath has engineered a political situation that threatens to erupt into continental war.

Velthoryn and his allies recognize this strategy but find themselves at a disadvantage following the extinction of the gold dragons. Their counter-strategy focuses on identifying and supporting key humanoid agents who might navigate the complex political landscape and prevent the worst outcomes of Ignarath's machinations.

#### The Panopicon Gambit

In a move of unprecedented desperation, **[[VelthorynTheSilverSentinel]]** has recently established secret communication with the crews of the [[EmColonizationFleet]]—advanced observers who have maintained a hidden presence known as **[[The Panopticon]]** for several thousand years. These watchers have remained in strict observational mode, documenting but never interfering with Orbis' development.

Velthoryn has begun pleading with these ancient visitors to emerge from their long isolation and tip the balance in favor of humanoid civilizations. This controversial approach has not been shared with most Council members, as it represents a fundamental break with the ancient compact that has governed draconic affairs for millennia.

If successful, this gambit could introduce an entirely new power to the equation—one with knowledge and capabilities beyond even the most ancient dragons. However, it also risks unforeseen consequences that could permanently alter the nature of Orbis itself.

The coming conflict will determine not just the political boundaries of humanoid nations, but the fundamental relationship between dragons and humanoids for generations to come.

### **Quick notes:**

- [[VelthorynTheSilverSentinel]]
- _Sylvrath_ — strong roots in the [[Emerald Brood]] mythos.
- _Vorthyx_ — aggressive about coastline and storm domain sovereignty.
- _Chemraza_ — quiet plotter, non-direct actor, loves long decay arcs.
- _Droskithar_ — one of the most alien, feeds on magic rather than territory.
- _Zythara_ — almost never moves physically, projects power into astral and dream realms.
- _Ithryzkal_ — strongest pure mentalist, rarely speaks in direct terms.

## Aftermath of the Purge
Several gold-lineage ancients who had advocated for cautious engagement with the Luminarian Empire were killed or driven from Orbis during the chromatic-led purge that followed revelations about Na-era technology. The loss of these voices shifted the Council's balance toward more hardline anti-technological positions and remains a primary source of schism between metallic and chromatic factions today.
