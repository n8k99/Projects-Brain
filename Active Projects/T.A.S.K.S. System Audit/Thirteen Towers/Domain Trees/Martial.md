# Martial Domain - The Thirteen Towers

## Domain Overview

**Core Question:** "How is physical force applied and organized?"

**Sphere of Influence:** Individual violence, troop formations, fortifications, sieges, logistics, and the movement of armed bodies.

**What Martial Characters Shape:**
- Who wins battles and how
- What territory can be held or taken
- Which forces can march where
- How violence is organized and distributed

---

## Martial Domain Philosophy

Martial power on Orbis is not just about individual prowess—it's about understanding how force scales from a single blade to continental armies. Early progression focuses on personal capability and small-unit tactics. Mid-tier nodes concern themselves with formations, supply lines, and fortifications. High-tier and Apex nodes allow you to move armies, reshape battlefields, and become a strategic force that realms must account for.

The Martial domain intersects with every other domain:
- **+ Covert:** Intelligence-driven warfare, special operations
- **+ Economic:** Mercenary armies, siege logistics
- **+ Political:** Legitimacy of force, military authority
- **+ Spiritual:** Crusades, holy wars, warrior cults
- **+ Magic/Tech:** Monument-based weapons, anomaly tactics

---

## Martial Trees

The Martial domain contains multiple progression trees. Characters may pursue nodes from any tree as they meet fictional requirements. Most Martial characters focus on 2-3 trees over their career.
