# Domain Overview
## Development Priorities and Philosophy

The Thirteen Towers gaming system emphasizes **investigation, intelligence gathering, and coordination** over combat. Domain development priorities reflect this focus.

## Development Priority Percentages

| Domain | Development % | Focus |
|--------|--------------|-------|
| **Covert** | 30-40% | PRIMARY - Intelligence, investigation, infiltration |
| **Political** | 25-30% | Diplomacy, alliance-building, authority |
| **Spiritual** | 20-25% | Lore, metaphysical investigation, patterns |
| **Magic/Tech** | 15-20% | Monument research, Tower functions, artifacts |
| **Economic** | 10-15% | Resource intelligence, logistics coordination |
| **Martial** | 5-10% | MINIMAL - Combat is not the primary mode |

## Why This Distribution?

### Combat Exists But Is NOT The Focus

The campaign centers on:
- Discovering the truth about the Cull cycle
- Building alliances across fractured civilizations
- Investigating Tower mysteries and Monument networks
- Coordinating multi-realm intelligence operations
- Navigating dragon politics and AF64 presence
- Making ethical decisions under pressure

**Combat is a consequence of failed diplomacy, necessary defense, or last resort** — not the primary problem-solving mode.

## Domain Tree Structure

Each domain contains multiple Trees, each with 6-10 nodes progressing through tiers:

**Tiers:**
- Novice (entry-level)
- Journeyman (competent)
- Adept (skilled)
- Expert (masterful)
- Master (legendary)
- Apex (world-changing, convergence point)

## Primary Domain: [[T.A.S.K.S. System Audit/Thirteen Towers/Domain Trees/Covert]] (30-40%)

**Five Major Trees:**

1. **Intelligence Networks** - Building and managing spy networks
2. **Investigation Techniques** - Finding truth through evidence and analysis
3. **Infiltration** - Access to restricted places and information
4. **Counter-Intelligence** - Detecting and neutralizing enemy intelligence
5. **Information Warfare** - Controlling narratives and information flow

**Why Primary:**
- Players spend most time gathering intelligence
- Cull cycle discovery requires investigation
- Dragon manipulation is subtle, requires detection
- AF64 and Monuments must be understood through study
- Multi-realm coordination depends on information sharing

## Secondary Domains

### Political (25-30%)
**Focus:** Faction Navigation, Diplomacy, Alliance Building, Authority/Legitimacy, Treaty Crafting

Essential for coordinating response to Cull cycle and building planetary unity.

### Spiritual (20-25%)
**Focus:** Lore Understanding, Metaphysical Investigation, Belief Systems, Pattern Recognition

Critical for understanding how the Spiritual Field works, dragon possession, and Monument responses.

### Magic/Tech (15-20%)
**Focus:** Monument Research, Tower Functions, Chronicle Decipherment, Artifact Analysis

Necessary for uncovering the truth about Towers and interfacing with AF64 systems.

### Economic (10-15%)
**Focus:** Resource Intelligence, Supply Networks, Coordination Logistics

Supports alliance-building and rebellion logistics in Acts 4-5.

### Martial (5-10% - Minimal)
**Focus:** Functional combat capabilities, command structures

Adequate for necessary conflicts but not the solution to most problems.

## How Characters Develop Across Domains

**Typical character at Episode 60:**
- **Primary Domain** (6-8 nodes): Deep expertise in one area
- **Secondary Domains** (2-4 nodes each): Competence in 2-3 complementary areas
- **Tertiary knowledge** (1-2 nodes): Occasional useful capabilities

**Example Investigation-Focused Character:**
- Covert/Intelligence Networks: 7 nodes (Novice → Master)
- Political/Diplomacy: 4 nodes (Novice → Expert)
- Spiritual/Lore Understanding: 3 nodes (Novice → Adept)
- Magic-Tech/Monument Research: 2 nodes (Novice → Journeyman)

**Example Coordination-Focused Character:**
- Political/Alliance Building: 6 nodes (Novice → Master)
- Covert/Intelligence Networks: 4 nodes (Novice → Expert)
- Economic/Supply Networks: 3 nodes (Novice → Adept)
- Spiritual/Belief Systems: 2 nodes (Novice → Journeyman)

## Advancement Is Fictional, Not Mechanical

**You don't grind XP.** You advance by:
- Forming NPC relationships (trainers, mentors, contacts)
- Making meaningful choices aligned with domain values
- Completing story milestones
- Building institutional ties
- Discovering knowledge through investigation

**Example Advancement Triggers:**
- "Gain trust of three regional spymasters" (Covert)
- "Negotiate treaty between hostile factions" (Political)
- "Decode complete Chronicle fragment" (Magic/Tech)
- "Establish cross-realm supply route" (Economic)
- "Lead successful ritual witnessed by 100+ believers" (Spiritual)

## Node Interpretation Across Acts

**Critical Feature:** Most nodes have multiple interpretations that shift across the five-act structure.

**Example: "Strategic Resource Coordinator" (Economic Domain)**

- **Act 2 interpretation:** "Coordinate recovery of lost agricultural knowledge"
- **Act 4 interpretation:** "Coordinate rebellion supply chains"
- **Act 5 reality:** "Coordinate fleet logistics operations"

Same mechanical benefit, different narrative frame depending on what players understand about the world.

## Using Trees in Play

### For Players:
1. Choose domains that interest you
2. Pursue NPC relationships in those domains
3. Make choices aligned with domain values
4. Unlock nodes through story progression
5. Use node benefits to gain Edge in relevant situations

### For GMs:
1. Offer NPCs who can teach domain knowledge
2. Create situations where domain expertise matters
3. Reward investigation more than combat
4. Track advancement triggers naturally through story
5. Let players discover which domains matter most
