# Information Warfare Tree
## Controlling Narratives and Manipulating Belief

This tree represents your ability to wage warfare through information, propaganda, and narrative control. Information Warfare specialists understand that controlling what people believe is as powerful as controlling territory—and often more durable. In a world where stories shape reality, those who control narratives wield invisible armies.

## APEX DISCOVERY

**At Reality Engineer tier, characters realize:**

You control truth itself. What you say is real becomes real. Civilization believes what you tell them. You've engineered reality through narrative.

And then you notice: information control worked *too* well. Populations accepted your narratives *too* readily. Alternative views vanished *too* completely. You start to suspect total information control has been *permitted*—that something vast finds comprehensive narrative management useful.

The horrible question: Have you created necessary information order, or have you built the perfect thought-control system? Do Dragons allow information hegemony because populations that believe approved narratives are easier to harvest than populations with diverse, chaotic beliefs? When everyone believes the same truth, are they enlightened—or are they uniformly controlled?

Your reality engineering might be the ultimate Cull infrastructure—a population that polices its own thoughts.

**GM Note:** This is the realization that information control might serve the Cull cycle—that Dragons permit comprehensive narrative management because unified, controlled belief systems make populations more predictable and manageable than information chaos. The Reality Engineer has created perfect information control that makes the population perfectly controllable. The revelation should emerge gradually through play, not as a single moment.
