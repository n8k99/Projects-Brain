# Diplomacy Tree
## Negotiation, Treaty-Making, and De-escalation

This tree represents your ability to negotiate agreements, prevent conflicts, and broker deals between parties. Diplomacy specialists turn enemies into allies and wars into treaties.

**Fictional Scale:** Village Mediator → International Negotiator → Continental Peacemaker

---

## Mediator (Novice Tier)

**Advancement Trigger:** Successfully negotiate a resolution to a local dispute that satisfies both parties

**Prerequisites:** None

### Features:

#### Read the Room
**Mechanical Effect:** When entering a negotiation, spend 1 Stress to ask the GM one of the following questions, which they must answer truthfully:
- What does this party truly want (vs. what they're claiming)?
- What is this party willing to compromise on?
- What line will this party not cross?
- Who has the real decision-making power here?

**Act Interpretations:**
- Act 2: "Understanding what knowledge seekers truly need vs. what they claim"
- Act 4: "Identifying rebellion factions' real priorities"
- Act 5: "Reading fleet command's actual strategic concerns"

#### Face-Saving Exit
**Mechanical Effect:** When negotiations are failing, you can propose a face-saving solution that allows parties to withdraw without losing honor or credibility. Both parties must be able to claim some form of victory, even if small. This doesn't guarantee they'll accept, but you can always find the dignified exit.

Once per session, you can spend 2 Stress to make a face-saving proposal so compelling that refusing it would make the party look unreasonable to observers.

**Act Interpretations:**
- Act 2: "Allowing failed expeditions to claim partial knowledge recovery"
- Act 4: "Letting occupation forces withdraw while claiming order restored"
- Act 5: "Giving AF64 elements a way to stand down without losing face"

#### Negotiation Fundamentals
**Mechanical Effect:** Passive +1 Edge on all diplomatic negotiations. You understand leverage, compromise, and when to push vs. when to yield.

## Treaty Negotiator (Journeyman Tier)

**Advancement Trigger:** Successfully negotiate a formal agreement between factions or nobles that holds for at least 3 sessions

**Prerequisites:** At least one feature from Mediator

### Features:

#### Binding Language
**Mechanical Effect:** You can draft agreements that are both clear and enforceable. When crafting treaties or contracts:
- You can identify loopholes before signing
- You can write terms that satisfy multiple parties' concerns
- Your treaties have clear enforcement mechanisms

Once per session, when someone tries to violate or reinterpret one of your treaties, you can spend 1 Stress to reveal the specific clause that prevents their interpretation. The GM must honor your original intent.

**Act Interpretations:**
- Act 2: "Knowledge-sharing protocols that protect sources"
- Act 4: "Resistance treaties with clear terms of alliance"
- Act 5: "Fleet coordination agreements with enforcement clauses"

**Prerequisite for:** Constitutional Framework (Crisis Diplomat)

#### Trust Building Protocol
**Mechanical Effect:** You can establish trust between hostile parties through graduated commitments. When mediating between enemies:
- Propose small, verifiable actions that build credibility
- Create neutral oversight mechanisms
- Design reciprocal confidence-building measures

You maintain a Trust track with each party (0-5 boxes). Each time a party honors a commitment, mark +1 Trust. You can spend Trust:
- **1 Trust:** Party accepts your mediation on a minor issue
- **2 Trust:** Party accepts your proposed compromise
- **3 Trust:** Party trusts you with sensitive information
- **5 Trust:** Party will agree to negotiate with their worst enemy if you broker it

Trust degrades by 1 per session if not actively maintained.

**Prerequisite for:** Good Faith Guarantee (Crisis Diplomat)

#### Spirit vs. Letter
**Mechanical Effect:** Passive +2 Edge on treaty negotiations. You understand the critical difference between technical compliance and actual intent, and can draft agreements that capture both.

When reviewing any agreement, you can immediately identify if parties interpret it differently.

## Crisis Diplomat (Adept Tier)

**Advancement Trigger:** Prevent a war or major violent conflict through diplomatic intervention

**Prerequisites:** 
- Binding Language (Political: Diplomacy)
- At least one feature from Covert domain OR Spiritual domain

### Features:

#### De-escalation Protocol
**Mechanical Effect:** When violence is imminent (armies mobilizing, weapons drawn, assassination plotted), you can intervene to create space for negotiation. Spend 2 Stress to:
- Demand a 24-hour ceasefire that both parties feel obligated to honor
- Propose an immediate neutral meeting ground
- Invoke a higher authority or principle both sides respect

During this window, you have +3 Edge on all diplomatic actions to find a peaceful resolution.

**Act Interpretations:**
- Act 2: "Preventing conflicts over recovered knowledge hoards"
- Act 4: "Stopping rebel factions from fighting each other instead of occupation"
- Act 5: "Preventing fleet elements from firing on each other"

**Prerequisite:** Trust Building Protocol

#### Creative Compromise
**Mechanical Effect:** You can find solutions that satisfy parties' core needs even when their stated positions are incompatible. Once per session, when negotiations seem deadlocked, spend 1 Stress and propose a creative compromise. The GM must either:
- Accept that your compromise satisfies both parties' core needs, OR
- Explain what critical need remains unmet

This reveals what the real sticking point is, even if parties won't admit it.

**Act Interpretations:**
- Act 2: "Finding ways to share knowledge that protects source cultures"
- Act 4: "Satisfying both revenge desires and strategic needs"
- Act 5: "Balancing human sovereignty with AF64 oversight requirements"

#### Constitutional Framework
**Mechanical Effect:** You can propose governance frameworks that de-escalate conflicts by changing how decisions are made. Instead of "who wins," you propose "how we decide together."

When parties fight over who controls something, you can design:
- Shared governance councils
- Rotating authority
- Checks and balances between rivals
- Neutral arbitration mechanisms

These proposals have +2 Edge to be accepted because they let everyone save face.

**Prerequisite:** Binding Language

## International Envoy (Expert Tier)

**Advancement Trigger:** Successfully represent a realm in high-stakes negotiations with other major powers (war/peace, major treaties, critical alliances)

**Prerequisites:**
- At least two features from Crisis Diplomat
- At least one feature from Political: Alliance Building OR Political: Authority & Legitimacy

### Features:

#### Realm-Level Negotiation
**Mechanical Effect:** You negotiate treaties that shape realms: military alliances, trade pacts, border agreements, succession arrangements. You have +3 Edge on all realm-level diplomatic missions.

Your reputation grants you access to rulers and decision-makers. When seeking audience with realm leaders, you can spend 1 Stress to have them make time for you within 1d6 hours.

**Act Interpretations:**
- Act 2: "Negotiating knowledge-sharing pacts between Tower cities"
- Act 4: "Forging rebellion alliances across occupied territories"
- Act 5: "Crafting treaties between human realms and fleet elements"

**Prerequisite for:** Peace Architecture (Architect of Peace)

#### Leverage Mapping
**Mechanical Effect:** Before major negotiations, you can spend time studying the parties and their relationships. Spend 2 Stress and answer these questions yourself (subject to GM verification):
- What does each party need that only the other can provide?
- What is each party's best alternative to agreement?
- Who are each party's critical constituencies they must satisfy?
- What timeline pressures exist?

With this map, you have +2 Edge on the actual negotiation and can identify the zone of possible agreement.

**Prerequisite:** Creative Compromise

#### Multi-Party Coordination
**Mechanical Effect:** You can negotiate agreements involving 3+ parties with competing interests. You understand:
- How to sequence proposals so no party feels ganged up on
- How to balance power so no party dominates
- How to find common ground across multiple agendas

When coordinating multi-party negotiations, you can manage up to 5 parties simultaneously. For each party beyond 5, you take -1 Edge (reflecting coordination overhead).

**Prerequisite for:** Continental Convening (The Peacemaker)

---

## Architect of Peace (Master Tier)

**Advancement Trigger:** Broker a major peace treaty or alliance that reshapes the political landscape and holds for at least 10 sessions

**Prerequisites:**
- Realm-Level Negotiation (Political: Diplomacy)
- At least one feature from Political: Treaty Crafting
- At least one feature from Spiritual domain

### Features:

#### Peace Architecture
**Mechanical Effect:** You don't just negotiate treaties—you design peace frameworks that create lasting stability. When crafting major peace agreements, you can build in:
- Self-enforcing mechanisms (mutual benefit structures)
- Graduated implementation (trust-building stages)
- Conflict resolution protocols for future disputes
- Buy-in from affected constituencies

Your treaties are studied as masterworks of diplomatic design. +3 Edge on all peace treaty negotiations.

Once per arc, you can spend 3 Stress to craft a treaty so elegant that even parties who hate each other recognize its genius and feel obligated to honor it.

**Act Interpretations:**
- Act 2: "Creating continental knowledge-sharing frameworks"
- Act 4: "Designing rebellion coordination structures"
- Act 5: "Crafting human-AF64 coexistence protocols"

**Prerequisite:** Realm-Level Negotiation

#### Mediation Reputation
**Mechanical Effect:** Your reputation as neutral arbiter is legendary. When conflicts arise:
- Parties actively seek you out to mediate
- Your presence prevents violence (attacking during your mediation would shame the aggressor)
- Rulers trust your counsel before making war

You can retroactively declare that you had prepared mediation proposals for foreseeable conflicts. Spend 2 Stress to produce a ready-made framework for the current crisis.

**Act Interpretations:**
- Act 2: "Legendary keeper of diplomatic balance between Tower cities"
- Act 4: "The name rebellion factions invoke to prevent fratricidal conflict"
- Act 5: "The human mediator even fleet commanders respect"

#### Diplomatic Immunity
**Mechanical Effect:** Your status as negotiator is sacred. Even enemies honor your neutrality. You can:
- Travel safely through hostile territory while on diplomatic missions
- Meet with any party without fear of arrest or violence
- Invoke diplomatic protection for your delegation

Violating your diplomatic immunity would be a scandal that damages the violator's legitimacy. Spend 1 Stress to remind parties of the sacred nature of diplomatic envoys—they must either let you go or face consequences to their reputation.

## The Peacemaker (Apex Tier)

**Advancement Trigger:** Your diplomatic interventions prevent continental-scale wars and reshape civilization's approach to conflict

**Prerequisites:**
- Peace Architecture (Political: Diplomacy)
- At least one feature from Political: Alliance Building
- At least one feature from Covert: Intelligence Networks OR Spiritual: Lore Understanding
- At least one Master-tier feature from any other domain

### Features:

#### Continental Convening
**Mechanical Effect:** You can convene continental-scale peace conferences that bring together dozens of realms and factions. When you call for negotiations:
- Major powers feel obligated to send representatives
- Minor powers see attendance as legitimacy
- Neutral parties offer to host and support
- The mere announcement of your convening effort creates diplomatic pressure to resolve the conflict

You can coordinate negotiations involving up to 20 parties. +4 Edge on all continental-scale diplomatic efforts.

**Act Interpretations:**
- Act 2: "Convening planetary councils for knowledge recovery coordination"
- Act 4: "Calling continental rebellion coordination conferences"
- Act 5: "Organizing human-fleet grand negotiations"

**Prerequisite:** Multi-Party Coordination

#### Wars End When You Intervene
**Mechanical Effect:** Your reputation is so powerful that your intervention creates irresistible pressure to negotiate. Once per major conflict, when you personally intervene in a war or armed conflict, both sides must send representatives to negotiate or face catastrophic legitimacy costs.

This doesn't guarantee peace—but it forces negotiation. Refusing to talk when The Peacemaker offers mediation brands you as warmonger who values violence over civilization.

Spend 3 Stress to invoke this. Both parties must negotiate in good faith for at least three sessions, during which active combat is suspended.

**Act Interpretations:**
- Act 2: "Your presence stops conflicts over recovered knowledge"
- Act 4: "Occupation forces and rebellion both pause when you call for talks"
- Act 5: "Even Dragon-backed forces hesitate when you offer mediation"

#### Negotiate With Dragons
**Mechanical Effect:** You've reached the tier where you can attempt diplomatic engagement with Dragons—and occasionally succeed. Dragons recognize you as a peer negotiator (rare for humans).

When negotiating with Dragons or their Heralds:
- You have +2 Edge (instead of the usual penalties for dealing with vastly superior beings)
- Dragons take you seriously as a legitimate diplomatic counterpart
- You can propose terms that frame outcomes as Dragon victories (making agreement easier)

This doesn't make Dragons friendly or controllable—but it makes them willing to negotiate instead of simply imposing their will.

**Act Interpretations:**
- Act 2: "Mediating between Tower cities and local Dragon authorities"
- Act 4: "Negotiating with Dragons backing the occupation"
- Act 5: "Proposing terms to AF64 that acknowledge human sovereignty"

## APEX DISCOVERY

**At The Peacemaker tier, characters begin to notice:**

Your peace frameworks work *too* well. Treaties you negotiate hold even when parties have incentive to break them. Conflicts resolve more smoothly than they should. You start to suspect that something vast is *allowing* your diplomatic successes—that Dragons or AF64 find peace useful for their own purposes.

The horrible question: Are you building genuine peace, or are you unknowingly managing the Cull generation's conflicts to keep them from interfering with the larger pattern?

**GM Note:** This is the Peacemaker realizing they may be an unwitting tool of the Cull cycle—that their diplomatic genius has been permitted because it serves to keep civilizations stable enough for effective harvesting. The revelation should emerge gradually through play, not as a single moment.
