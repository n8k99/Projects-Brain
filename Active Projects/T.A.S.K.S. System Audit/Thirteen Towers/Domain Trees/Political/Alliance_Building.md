# Alliance Building Tree
## Creating and Maintaining Political Coalitions

This tree represents your ability to forge alliances, build coalitions, and create political power blocs. Alliance Building specialists bring together disparate factions into unified forces, turning fragmented opposition into coordinated power. In a fractured world, those who can unite others become kingmakers.

**Fictional Scale:** Local Alliance → Multi-City Coalition → Continental League

## Connector (Novice Tier)

**Advancement Trigger:** Successfully bring together two parties for mutual benefit, creating a relationship that persists

**Prerequisites:** None

### Features:

#### Common Ground
**Mechanical Effect:** You can identify what different factions need and find areas of mutual interest. You have +1 Edge on persuading factions to cooperate.

When mediating between parties, you can:
- Identify their true interests (vs. stated positions)
- Find win-win scenarios both sides accept
- Frame cooperation as serving each party's goals
- Overcome historical distrust through practical incentives

**Act Interpretations:**
- Act 2: "Connecting Tower cities for knowledge sharing"
- Act 4: "Uniting resistance factions against occupation"
- Act 5: "Building human alliances for fleet negotiations"

**Prerequisite for:** Coalition Management (Coalition Builder)

#### Valuable Introduction
**Mechanical Effect:** You can make introductions that create lasting relationships:
- Connect people who should work together
- Broker initial meetings between potential allies
- Provide credibility to both parties
- Follow up to ensure relationships develop

When you introduce two parties:
- They trust your judgment (you wouldn't waste their time)
- They're predisposed to cooperate (your recommendation matters)
- You gain social capital with both (they owe you for the connection)

Once per session, you can spend 1 Stress to retroactively declare "I know someone who can help"—you've already cultivated a relationship with exactly the right person for current needs.

**Act Interpretations:**
- Act 2: "Introducing scholars to recovery specialists"
- Act 4: "Connecting resistance cells for coordination"
- Act 5: "Brokering first contact between human leaders and fleet elements"

#### Mutual Benefit Framing
**Mechanical Effect:** You know how to frame cooperation so each party feels they're winning:
- Emphasize what each side gains
- Downplay what each side concedes
- Create narratives where cooperation is smart self-interest
- Avoid zero-sum framing

This doesn't require deception—just emphasizing the right aspects of the deal.

**Prerequisites:** At least one feature from Connector

### Features:

#### Coalition Management
**Mechanical Effect:** You can manage coalitions effectively—mediating disputes, distributing benefits, maintaining cohesion. You have +2 Edge on alliance-building efforts.

You can:
- Balance competing interests within the coalition
- Prevent internal conflicts from destroying the alliance
- Ensure each faction feels represented
- Distribute victories and resources fairly

When your coalition faces internal tension, spend 1 Stress to immediately mediate and prevent fracture.

**Act Interpretations:**
- Act 2: "Managing multi-city knowledge recovery consortiums"
- Act 4: "Coordinating fractious resistance coalitions"
- Act 5: "Maintaining human unity despite factional interests"

**Mechanical Effect:** You know how to make each party feel they're winning—even when making compromises:
- Frame concessions as strategic choices
- Emphasize victories (even small ones)
- Create "wins" that satisfy different audiences
- Manage internal coalition messaging

This keeps factions committed even when they don't get everything they want. You prevent "they got more than we did" resentment that destroys coalitions.

**Prerequisite for:** Managed Competition (Political Organizer)

#### Resource Coordination
**Mechanical Effect:** You coordinate coalition resources for mutual benefit:
- Pool resources from multiple factions
- Allocate combined resources strategically
- Create economies of scale through cooperation
- Demonstrate tangible benefits of alliance

Coalition members contribute resources they wouldn't commit individually because they see collective impact.

Once per major operation, you can pool coalition resources for an effort that no single faction could accomplish alone.

---

## Political Organizer (Adept Tier)

**Advancement Trigger:** Build a lasting political organization or movement that has formal structure and persists without your constant direct involvement

**Prerequisites:**
- Coalition Management (Political: Alliance Building)
- At least one feature from Political: Diplomacy OR Political: Treaty Crafting
- At least one feature from Economic: Supply Networks OR Economic: Coordination & Logistics

### Features:

#### Institutional Alliance
**Mechanical Effect:** You create institutional alliances—guilds, councils, leagues—with formal structure. You have +2 Edge when working within your coalition.

Your alliance has:
- Formal leadership structure (not just personal relationships)
- Established rules and procedures
- Shared resources (treasury, facilities, personnel)
- Regular meetings and communication protocols

The alliance persists even when you're absent—it's an institution, not just a coalition of convenience.

**Act Interpretations:**
- Act 2: "Founding the Continental Knowledge Recovery Council"
- Act 4: "Establishing the Resistance Coordination League"
- Act 5: "Creating the Human Sovereign Congress"

**Prerequisite:** Coalition Management  
**Prerequisite for:** League Architecture (Kingmaker)

#### Mutual Defense
**Mechanical Effect:** Member factions defend each other:
- Attack on one member is attack on all
- Factions provide military/political support to allies under threat
- Coalition members can call on others for protection
- Aggressors face collective response

This makes your coalition militarily and politically powerful—attacking any member triggers coordinated response.

Once per major conflict, you can invoke mutual defense to mobilize the entire coalition against a threat to any member.

**Prerequisite for:** Coalition Military (League Architect)

#### Managed Competition
**Mechanical Effect:** You channel internal competition into productive directions:
- Factions compete for coalition leadership/status rather than fighting
- Competition drives performance rather than creating conflict
- You recognize and reward contributions
- You prevent zero-sum thinking

This keeps ambitious factions engaged without destroying the alliance—they compete within the coalition rather than leaving it.

**Prerequisite:** Perception Management

#### Endorsement Power
**Mechanical Effect:** Leaders seek your endorsement to legitimize their authority:
- Your backing validates claims to leadership
- Your refusal delegitimizes pretenders
- Factions compete for your support
- You can make or break political careers

When you publicly endorse a leader or candidate:
- They gain +2 Edge on legitimacy-based actions
- Opposition must overcome your endorsement
- Your faction supporters rally to them

When you withdraw support, the opposite occurs—the leader faces legitimacy crisis.

**Prerequisite for:** Make and Break Rulers (Continental Hegemon)

#### Coalition Discipline
**Mechanical Effect:** You can enforce coalition decisions on reluctant members:
- Factions that violate coalition agreements face consequences
- You can isolate or sanction defectors
- Collective pressure brings wayward members back in line
- Exit costs are high (leaving means losing coalition benefits)

When a coalition member acts against alliance interests, you can:
- Spend 2 Stress to immediately convene coalition response
- Mobilize other members to pressure the defector

---

## League Architect (Master Tier)

Your league has:
- Decision-making bodies (councils, assemblies, committees)
- Binding resolution processes (members must comply)
- Enforcement mechanisms (sanctions, exclusion, intervention)
- Shared institutions (courts, treasuries, militaries)

Member states delegate authority to the league on specified matters—they give up sovereignty in specific areas for collective benefit.

**Act Interpretations:**
- Act 2: "The Continental Recovery Confederation"
- Act 4: "The Resistance Federation with unified command"
- Act 5: "The Human League with diplomatic sovereignty"

**Prerequisite for:** Continental Norms (Continental Hegemon)

#### Coalition Military
**Mechanical Effect:** You can mobilize league military resources for collective operations:
- Combined forces from multiple members
- Unified command structure
- Shared logistics and intelligence
- Coordinated strategic planning

The league can wage war, conduct peacekeeping, or defend members with military forces that rival major realms.

Once per major conflict, you can mobilize the league military for a coordinated campaign that no single member could accomplish alone.

**Prerequisite:** Mutual Defense

#### Resource Pooling
**Mechanical Effect:** League members pool resources systematically:
- Shared treasuries for collective projects
- Economic coordination for mutual benefit
- Combined diplomatic representation
- Pooled intelligence and information

The league commands resources equivalent to a major realm—making it a geopolitical force.

When the league commits resources to an objective, you can spend 3 Stress to marshal resources that would be impossible for any single faction.

- Act 4: "Unified Resistance controls majority of human territories"
- Act 5: "Human League represents unified species position"

#### Continental Norms
**Mechanical Effect:** You set continental norms—trade rules, diplomatic protocols, military standards:
- League standards become expected practice
- Deviation from norms carries political cost
- New realms adopt league frameworks to gain legitimacy
- Your league's rules are "how things are done"

You've created the political operating system for continental civilization.

When you establish a new norm, spend 4 Stress to have it become widely adopted within 1d6 months. Realms that refuse face isolation and sanctions.

**Prerequisite:** League Governance

#### Make and Break Rulers
**Mechanical Effect:** You can make or break political leadership at continental scale:
- Your endorsement can install rulers

## APEX DISCOVERY

**At Continental Hegemon tier, characters realize:**

Your league succeeded *too* well. Factions unified too easily. Opposition collapsed too quickly. Non-members isolated themselves too conveniently. You start to suspect your coalition building has been *permitted* to succeed—that something vast finds unified human political blocs useful.

The horrible question: Have you built genuine human unity, or have you organized the next Cull generation into convenient administrative units? Do Dragons allow leagues and confederations because centralized political structures are easier to manipulate and control than scattered independent realms?

When you unite millions under one banner, are you strengthening them—or just making them easier to harvest?

**GM Note:** This is the realization that political unification might serve the Cull cycle—that Dragons permit and even encourage human confederations because managing one unified political bloc is more efficient than managing dozens of independent realms. The Continental Hegemon has created the perfect administrative structure for planetary management. The revelation should emerge gradually through play, not as a single moment.
