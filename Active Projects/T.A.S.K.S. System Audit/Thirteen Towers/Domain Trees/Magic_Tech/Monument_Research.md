# Monument Research Tree
## Understanding and Using Monument Systems

This tree represents your ability to understand, operate, and manipulate Monument systems. Monuments are Colony-era technology—fabricators, medical bays, quantum gates, data stores—that most mistake for divine magic. Monument Research specialists navigate the dangerous territory between surface understanding and actual comprehension, knowing that too much knowledge attracts Draconic Attention.

**Fictional Scale:** Basic User → Monument Theorist → System Master

## Monument Theorist (Adept Tier)

**Advancement Trigger:** Develop a working theory of how Monuments actually function as technology rather than magic

**Prerequisites:**
- Monument Typology (Magic/Tech: Monument Research)
- At least one feature from Spiritual: Lore Understanding OR Covert: Investigation Techniques

### Features:

#### Operating Principles
**Mechanical Effect:** You understand Monuments as technology, not magic. This conceptual shift grants you +2 Edge on all Monument operations.

You comprehend:
- Monuments are manufactured devices, not divine creation
- They operate on consistent principles (physics, engineering, programming)
- "Magic" is reproducible technology
- Monument "prayers" are actually interface commands

This knowledge is dangerous—explaining it to others can trigger Draconic Attention. But it allows you to:
- Predict Monument behavior logically
- Troubleshoot problems systematically
- Understand Monument limitations are technological, not mystical

**Act Interpretations:**
- Act 2: "Beginning to suspect Monuments are ancient technology"
- Act 4: "Understanding Monuments as tools, not divine favor"
- Act 5: "Full comprehension of Colony-era technological nature"

**Prerequisite:** Monument Typology  
**Prerequisite for:** Monument Programming (Monument Master)

#### Predictive Modeling
**Mechanical Effect:** You can predict Monument behavior before testing. When planning to use a Monument function:
- You know what will happen
- You can estimate success probability
- You identify prerequisites and limitations
- You anticipate side effects

This allows safe experimentation—you test virtually before testing physically, avoiding dangerous failures.

Once per session, when attempting something novel with a Monument, you can spend 2 Stress to automatically know if it will work and what the consequences will be.

**Prerequisite for:** System Optimization (Monument Master)

#### Network Manipulation
**Mechanical Effect:** You can reroute or redirect Monument network connections. You can:
- Change which travel gates connect to which destinations
- Redirect Monument data flows
- Isolate Monuments from networks (prevents remote monitoring)
- Create new network connections between Monuments

This is powerful but dangerous—extensive network manipulation attracts Draconic Attention. Use sparingly and carefully.

**Prerequisite:** Monument Networks

---

## Monument Master (Expert Tier)

**Advancement Trigger:** Successfully manipulate Monument functions beyond their designed purpose without catastrophic malfunction

**Prerequisites:**
- Operating Principles (Magic/Tech: Monument Research)
- At least one feature from Covert domain

**Mechanical Effect:** You can "hack" Monument systems through limited reprogramming. You have +3 Edge on all Monument interactions.

You can:
- Modify Monument functions (within technological constraints)
- Create custom Monument responses to specific inputs
- Override Monument safety restrictions (dangerous)
- Access Monument diagnostic modes and hidden functions

When reprogramming a Monument, spend 2 Stress and describe what you want it to do. The GM will tell you if it's technically possible and what risks are involved.

**Act Interpretations:**
- Act 2: "Reprogramming Monuments to reveal hidden Chronicle data"
- Act 4: "Hacking Monuments to support resistance operations"
- Act 5: "Modifying Monument functions to bypass AF64 oversight"

**Prerequisite:** Operating Principles  
**Prerequisite for:** Monument Creation (System Architect)

#### Dormant Function Activation
**Mechanical Effect:** You can activate Monument capabilities that are currently dormant or disabled:
- Find hidden Monument modes
- Restore deactivated functions
- Access Monument features others don't know exist
- Reactivate damaged Monument systems

Some dormant functions are disabled for good reason—they're dangerous, unstable, or draw Draconic Attention. Proceed carefully.

Once per arc, you can discover a completely unknown Monument function that proves critically useful to current operations.

**Prerequisite for:** System Architecture (System Architect)

#### Attention Minimization
**Mechanical Effect:** You know which Monument actions attract Draconic Attention and how to minimize detection:
- Understand what Dragons monitor
- Know how to use Monuments quietly
- Can mask unauthorized Monument usage
- Identify which functions are "safe" vs. monitored

You have +3 Edge on avoiding Draconic Attention when using Monuments.

When using Monuments in ways that should attract attention, you can spend 3 Stress to avoid detection for one operation.

## System Architect (Master Tier)

**Advancement Trigger:** Understand Monument network architecture at system level—how Monuments coordinate, share data, and maintain themselves

**Prerequisites:**
- Monument Programming (Magic/Tech: Monument Research)
- At least one feature from Covert: Intelligence Networks
- At least one Master-tier feature from any other domain

### Features:

#### System-Level Comprehension
**Mechanical Effect:** You comprehend the Monument network as designed infrastructure. You have +3 Edge on all Monument systems work.

You understand:
- Monument network topology and architecture
- How Monuments coordinate operations
- Central control systems and protocols
- Monument maintenance and self-repair systems
- How Dragons monitor and manage Monument usage

This knowledge reveals the Monuments are part of a managed planetary infrastructure—not independent divine sites.

**Act Interpretations:**
- Act 2: "Understanding Monuments as integrated planetary system"
- Act 4: "Recognizing Monument networks as Dragon control infrastructure"
- Act 5: "Comprehending Colony-era infrastructure design"

**Prerequisite for:** Infrastructure Control (The Engineer)

#### Network Architecture
**Mechanical Effect:** You can reroute Monument connections at system level:

- Establish new primary connections
- Design Monument network topology

You might:
- Create private Monument networks Dragons can't easily monitor
- Reroute Monument resources to support specific operations
- Isolate critical Monuments from Dragon oversight
- Design redundant systems for resilience

This is extremely dangerous—large-scale network manipulation WILL attract Draconic Attention. But it's also extraordinarily powerful.

**Prerequisite:** Network Manipulation

#### Monument Creation Theory
**Mechanical Effect:** You understand how Monuments are manufactured. You could design Monument-equivalent systems if you had the means.

You comprehend:
- Monument construction principles
- Material requirements and fabrication processes
- Power systems and energy sources
- Programming and control systems

You cannot actually build new Monuments (you lack facilities, materials, and infrastructure)—but you understand the theory. With sufficient resources, you could:
- Repair seriously damaged Monuments
- Create Monument subsystems
- Design Monument variants for specific purposes
- Reverse-engineer Monument technology

**Prerequisite:** Monument Programming

---

## The Engineer (Apex Tier)

**Advancement Trigger:** You understand Colony infrastructure completely—you've reverse-engineered Monument technology and could build them if you had the means

**Prerequisites:**
- System-Level Comprehension (Magic/Tech: Monument Research)
- At least one Master-tier feature from Magic/Tech: Tower Functions
- At least one Master-tier feature from Covert domain
- At least one Master-tier feature from Spiritual OR Political domain

### Features:

#### Complete Understanding
**Mechanical Effect:** You know Monument technology inside-out. You understand:
- Monument design and engineering completely
- How to build Monument-equivalent systems
- Monument manufacturing and maintenance infrastructure
- All Monument functions, including hidden ones
- How Dragons use Monuments for surveillance and control

You can:
- Design new Monument variants for any purpose
- Modify existing Monuments extensively
- Create Monument-like technology from scratch (given resources)
- Understand Monument code and programming completely

This makes you one of the most dangerous humans alive—you know too much.

**Act Interpretations:**
- Act 2: "Understanding Monuments as Colony fabrication technology"
- Act 4: "Comprehending Dragon use of Monuments for Cull infrastructure"
- Act 5: "Full reverse-engineering of AF64 technological systems"

#### Infrastructure Control
**Mechanical Effect:** You can manipulate Monument infrastructure at planetary scale:
- Control Monument networks across continents
- Create or destroy Monument functions systematically
- Establish independent Monument networks free from Dragon oversight
- Design alternative technological systems that rival Monuments

Once per major operation, you can spend 5 Stress to:
- Shut down Monument networks across entire regions
- Redirect Monument resources to support rebellion operations
- Create technological capabilities Dragons thought only they controlled
- Demonstrate technological independence from Dragon infrastructure

This is civilizational-level capability—and civilizational-level danger.

#### The Dangerous Knowledge
**Mechanical Effect:** You've crossed the threshold—Dragons see you as a potential threat because you understand their technological control mechanisms.

Your knowledge means:
- You can explain to others how Monuments actually work
- You can teach Monument engineering to new generations
- You can design alternatives to Dragon-controlled infrastructure
- You can threaten Dragon technological monopoly

This is existentially dangerous. AF64 evaluates whether you're a valuable asset or a threat to be eliminated. Dragons must decide whether to:
- Recruit you (make you a Herald or technical advisor)
- Contain you (prevent knowledge spread)
- Eliminate you (terminal threat to Cull infrastructure)

Your complete understanding makes you invaluable—and possibly doomed.

## APEX DISCOVERY

**At The Engineer tier, characters realize:**

The entire Monument network is *designed* to be partially accessible. Humans are *meant* to use basic functions. The "mysterious divine technology" framing is *intentional*—it keeps humans dependent without understanding.

The Monuments aren't ancient relics discovered by chance. They're carefully maintained infrastructure, designed to keep civilization at exactly the right technological level. Not too primitive (can't sustain population for harvesting), not too advanced (might develop independence).

You've mastered the technology—but the technology was designed to be masterable by sufficiently dedicated humans. Have you achieved genuine understanding, or have you just progressed along the permitted knowledge path?

Dragons allow Monument Masters to exist because they need human maintenance technicians who don't fully understand what they're maintaining. The horrible question: Are you genuinely free, or the most sophisticated kind of controlled?

**GM Note:** This is the realization that Monument knowledge has permitted boundaries—humans can learn to operate and maintain the systems, but complete independence would require manufacturing capability, which Dragons have carefully monopolized. The Engineer understands the cage completely—which makes it more horrifying, not less. The revelation should emerge gradually through play, not as a single moment.
