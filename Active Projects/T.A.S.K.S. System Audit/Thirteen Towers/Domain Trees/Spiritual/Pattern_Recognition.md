# Pattern Recognition Tree

## Pattern Spotter (Novice)
**Trigger:** Notice meaningful pattern others missed
**Effect:** +1 Edge recognizing patterns in events/data
**Acts:** "Find coincidences" → "Spot Cull patterns" → "Recognize designed systems"

## Cycle Reader (Journeyman)
**Trigger:** Predict event based on historical cycle
**Effect:** +2 Edge understanding cyclical patterns. Anticipate recurrences.
**Acts:** "Seasonal patterns" → "Cull cycle prediction" → "Long-term cycles"

## System Analyst (Adept)
**Trigger:** Map complete system from partial observations
**Effect:** +2 Edge inferring system structure. Predict system behaviors.
**Acts:** "Political systems" → "Dragon management systems" → "AF64 evaluation systems"

## Emergent Seer (Expert)
**Trigger:** Correctly predict emergent property from component behaviors
**Effect:** +3 Edge all pattern work. See second and third-order effects.
**Acts:** "Social emergence" → "Cull trigger thresholds" → "Galactic power dynamics"

## The Weaver (Apex)
**Trigger:** Recognize the meta-pattern connecting all Orbis patterns
**Effect:** +4 Edge pattern recognition. You see the design behind designed systems.
**DISCOVERS:** Orbis itself is a designed pattern-recognition test. (GM: Players realize they're being evaluated on this capacity.)
