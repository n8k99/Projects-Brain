# Draconic Attention
## When the Dragons Notice You

---

## What Is Draconic Attention?

**Draconic Attention** represents the oversight of the Dragons who administer Orbis. When characters perform significant actions that affect the realm's stability, patterns, or power structures, they risk attracting notice from entities with godlike perspective and reach.

**Core Principle**: The Dragons watch. When you make waves, they may respond.

---

## How Draconic Attention Works

### The Basic Mechanic

When a triggering action occurs, the GM rolls a **Draconic Attention Check**:

> **GM rolls 1d20 + Trigger Severity**
>
> **vs. Difficulty 15 (standard threshold)**

**Success (15+)**: The Dragons notice. Consequences follow (see Response Table).
**Failure (<15)**: The action slips beneath notice. No immediate response.

### Severity Modifiers

Different actions have different severity values that modify the GM's roll:

| Severity | Modifier | Example Actions |
|----------|----------|-----------------|
| **Trivial** | +0 | Minor Monument interaction, local politics |
| **Notable** | +2 | Activating Monument functions, realm-level intrigue |
| **Significant** | +4 | Disrupting key power structures, Tower proximity |
| **Major** | +6 | Directly opposing Dragon policy, Monument manipulation |
| **Critical** | +8 | Threatening Orbis stability, Tower intrusion |

## Accumulation & Threshold

### Attention Tracker

The GM maintains a **Draconic Attention Tracker** for the party (not individual PCs).

Each time a Draconic Attention Check **succeeds** (Dragons notice):
- Mark +1 Attention
- If Attention reaches **threshold 5**, the Dragons take **direct action**

### Threshold Actions

When Attention hits 5:
1. **Reset Attention to 0**
2. **Dragons intervene** (see Response Table below)
3. **The party knows** - dragon agents appear, visions occur, Monuments activate

### Attention Decay

Attention decays slowly:
- **-1 Attention** per month of quiet activity (no triggering actions)
- **-2 Attention** if the party actively helps Dragon interests
- **Complete reset** if the party proves they're working within acceptable parameters

---

## Dragon Response Table

When Attention reaches threshold 5, roll 1d6 + (Current Act of campaign):

| Roll | Response | Effect |
|------|----------|--------|
| **1-3** | Observation | Dragon agents (humanoid, subtle) observe the party. No direct action yet. |
| **4-5** | Warning | Clear message delivered: "You are noticed. Adjust behavior or face consequences." |
| **6-7** | Intervention | Monuments near the party activate to restrict their actions (gates close, artifacts deactivate). |
| **8-9** | Containment | Dragon agents actively work to limit party influence (political sabotage, resource denial). |
| **10-11** | Confrontation | A Dragon appears (or sends powerful proxy) to directly address the party. |
| **12+** | Erasure | The Dragons move to eliminate the party as a threat to stability. |

**Modifier**: Add the current Act number (Act 2 = +2, Act 5 = +5)

---

## Examples in Play

### Example 1: Monument Activation

**Situation**: The party activates an ancient Monument gate to bypass a three-week journey.

**Trigger**: Monument Manipulation (known function) = **+2 Severity**

**GM Roll**: 1d20 + 2 = 12 (no Attention - below threshold 15)

**Result**: The gate works. The Dragons don't notice this routine use.

---

### Example 2: Tower Approach

**Situation**: The party camps within 1 mile of the Glacial Pillar Tower to study its defensive patterns.

**Trigger**: Tower Proximity (within 1 mile) = **+4 Severity**

**GM Roll**: 1d20 + 4 = 18 (Attention triggered!)

**Result**: The Dragons notice. +1 to Attention Tracker (now at 1/5). That night, one PC has vivid dreams of being watched by enormous crystalline eyes.

---

### Example 3: Political Overthrow

**Situation**: The party orchestrates the overthrow of a corrupt duke and installs a revolutionary council.

**Trigger**: Political Disruption (realm-level change) = **+4 Severity**

**GM Roll**: 1d20 + 4 = 16 (Attention triggered!)

**Result**: +1 Attention (now at 2/5). Within a week, Monument functions in the region become subtly less responsive to the party.

---

### Example 4: Chronicle Discovery

**Situation**: The party deciphers a Chronicle fragment revealing the starship nature of the Towers.

**Trigger**: Knowledge Discovery (critical truth) = **+8 Severity**

**GM Roll**: 1d20 + 8 = 21 (Attention triggered!)

**Result**: +1 Attention (now at 3/5). Within days, dragon agents begin shadowing the party. The GM describes NPCs who ask unusually pointed questions about their research.

---

### Example 5: Threshold Reached

**Situation**: Attention tracker hits 5/5 after the party attempts to hack a Monument's control interface.

**Campaign**: Currently Act 3

**GM Roll on Response Table**: 1d6 + 3 (Act 3) = 8

**Result**: **Containment** - Dragon agents infiltrate the party's ally networks, turn key NPCs against them, and begin systematically cutting off their resources and influence.

---

## GM Guidance: When to Check

### Always Check For:
- Tower proximity (within 1 mile)
- Monument manipulation (beyond basic use)
- Major political upheaval
- Discovery of Earth-Age truths

### Consider Checking For:
- Oathbreaking with witnesses
- Anomaly weaponization
- Realm-shaking events

### Never Check For:
- Routine adventuring
- Local conflicts
- Personal drama
- Standard Monument use (established gates, shrines)

---

## Player Agency & Transparency

### How Much Should Players Know?

**Recommended Approach**: Medium transparency

**Tell players**:
- "That action might attract Draconic Attention" (before they commit)
- "You feel the weight of ancient eyes upon you" (when Attention triggers)
- "You're definitely on the Dragons' radar now" (when Attention is high)

**Don't tell players**:
- Exact Attention score (creates metagaming)
- Specific threshold numbers (ruins tension)
- Exact trigger categories (let them discover through play)

### Empowering Player Choice

Players should have enough information to make informed choices:
- **Before Tower approach**: Warn them it's risky
- **Before Monument hacking**: Signal this is dangerous territory
- **Before truth revelation**: Hint that some knowledge is watched

But don't rob them of discovery and consequence.

---

## Advanced: Mitigating Attention

### Ways to Reduce Scrutiny

1. **Work within Dragon-approved frameworks**
   - Use authorized Monument functions
   - Support stable governments
   - Report anomalies to authorities

2. **Prove usefulness**
   - Complete tasks that align with Dragon interests
   - Maintain stability in troubled regions
   - Act as local problem-solvers

3. **Lay low**
   - Avoid triggering actions for extended periods
   - Keep profile minimal
   - Work through intermediaries

4. **Misdirection** (requires Covert expertise)
   - Frame actions as someone else's doing
   - Create false trails
   - Make triggering actions look accidental

---

## Integration with Campaign Structure

### Act-Based Scaling

Early campaign (Acts 1-2):
- Dragons mostly ignore small-scale actions
- Attention threshold is forgiving
- Responses are subtle (observation, warnings)

Mid campaign (Acts 3-4):
- Dragons are more alert to pattern disruption
- Attention accumulates faster
- Responses include intervention and containment

Late campaign (Acts 5+):
- Dragons are actively concerned about party
- Attention threshold is sensitive
- Responses can be confrontational or hostile

### Thematic Use

Draconic Attention should:
- Reinforce that Orbis is administered
- Create tension around discovery
- Make Tower exploration feel dangerous
- Reward caution and planning (Covert domain!)

It should **not**:
- Feel arbitrary or punishing
- Block all interesting actions
- Become a bookkeeping chore
- Eliminate player agency

## Quick Reference: Response by Act

| Act | Typical Response (Threshold 5) | What It Looks Like |
|-----|-------------------------------|-------------------|
