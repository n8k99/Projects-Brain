# Core Resolution Mechanic
## Rolling Dice on Orbis

On Orbis, almost everything resolves through **single-roll conflict tests** that compare an effort die to a difficulty band, then layer on Position, Effect, and tags from Archetypes, Domains, and Trees. The baseline is simple: roll, read, narrate. The depth lives in what you risk and what you claim when you succeed.

---

## The Core Test

When you take a risky action whose outcome is uncertain and important, roll:

> **1d20 + Stat Mod + Edge** vs **Difficulty**

### Components:

- **Stat Mod** is the relevant attribute bonus (see [[T.A.S.K.S. System Audit/Thirteen Towers/Core Rules/03_Stats_and_Edge]])
- **Edge** is a small situational bonus or penalty (usually between –3 and +3, capped at –5 to +5) from:
  - Orbisian Character Type (Songbearer, Oathbound, etc.)
  - Domain context (Martial, Covert, Magic/Tech, Spiritual, Economic)
  - Relevant Tree nodes or Tags ("Warband Captain", "Market Shaper", "Anomaly Survivor")

**You do not stack long lists of modifiers.** Edge is the single number that sums all advantages and disadvantages the table agrees matter for this roll.

## Difficulty Bands

Difficulty is set in broad bands:

| Difficulty | Description | When to Use |
|-----------|-------------|------------|
| **8** | Trivial | Mostly succeeds unless badly positioned |
| **12** | Standard | Real risk but plausible |
| **16** | Hard | Needs skill, leverage, or help |
| **20+** | Extreme | Usually requires set-up, tools, or magic |

The GM sets difficulty based on the situation's inherent challenge, not the character's capability. A locked door doesn't get easier because an expert picks it — the expert just has higher Edge.

## Degrees of Outcome

On a test:

### **Success (beat Difficulty)**
You get what you wanted at the agreed Effect. Position may still justify a minor cost on very hard moves.

**Example:**
>You roll 18 vs Difficulty 16 while climbing the Tower wall in Risky Position. You reach the ledge (success), but the climb took longer than expected — guards are approaching.

### **Partial (meet Difficulty Exactly, or Beat it in Desperate Position)**
You succeed, but suffer a complication:
- Harm
- Resource drain
- Moral Strain
- New trouble

**Example:**
>You roll exactly 16 vs Difficulty 16 while decoding the Monument. You understand the message, but the Monument's light attracts nearby dragons.

### **Failure (below Difficulty)**
You do not achieve the goal. Position determines whether this is a bruise, a serious wound, a lost asset, or a strategic reversal.

**Example:**
>You roll 11 vs Difficulty 16 while trying to convince the baron. He rejects your proposal and has you escorted out. In Desperate Position, he might have you arrested.

## What Makes a Good Roll Call?

Not every action needs a roll. Only call for dice when:

1. **The outcome is uncertain** — An expert lockpick shouldn't roll for simple locks
2. **Failure has consequences** — If nothing bad happens on failure, just let them succeed
3. **Success matters** — If success doesn't change the situation, why roll?

### **Example: When NOT to Roll**

❌ **Bad:** "You're walking down the road. Roll Perception to notice the tavern."
- There's no uncertainty, and missing it has no consequence

✅ **Good:** "As you approach the tavern, you notice it's unusually quiet. Roll Perception to spot what's wrong."
- Failure means walking into an ambush unprepared

## Modifiers: Keep It Simple

The system intentionally keeps modifiers minimal. Instead of tracking:
```
+2 flanking, +1 high ground, +2 inspired, -1 wounded, +1 magic weapon...
```

You discuss the situation and agree on a single Edge number:
```
"You have surprise and high ground, but you're wounded. That's +2 Edge overall."
```

### **Philosophy:**
**Fiction first, math second.** The story determines what advantages matter, then you translate that into a single Edge modifier. This keeps play fast and narrative-focused.

---

## Special Cases

### **Unopposed Tests**
When acting against the environment or a static challenge, compare to the Difficulty bands above.

**Example:** Climbing a cliff, decoding a Chronicle fragment, resisting poison.

### **Opposed Tests**
When acting against another character, use their Defense (10 + Stat Mod + Edge) as the Difficulty.

**Example:** Arm wrestling, debates, stealth vs perception.

### **Group Tests**
When multiple characters work together:
- **Everyone rolls** if everyone's skill matters (climbing together)
- **Leader rolls with Edge from helpers** if one person directs (planning a heist)
- **Best roller with disadvantage** if coordination is tricky (sneaking as a group)

## Example in Play

> **GM:** "You're trying to convince the baron to join the alliance. He's skeptical because of past betrayals. That's Charm, Difficulty 16. What's your approach?"
>
> **Player (Songbearer):** "I remind him of the old songs about united kingdoms standing against dragons. I'm appealing to his culture's values."
>
> **GM:** "Good angle. Your Songbearer training gives you +2 Edge for cultural storytelling. You also have the 'Voice of the Shrine' Tree node from your time as a priest — that's another +1 for spiritual authority. So you're rolling d20 + Charm (+3) + Edge (+3) vs 16."
>
> **Player:** *rolls 10 + 3 + 3 = 16* "Exactly 16!"
>
> **GM:** "Partial success. He's moved by your words and agrees to consider the alliance, but demands a concession — you must agree to let his priests bless the treaty in his realm's tradition, which might offend your Celanthari allies."

## Edge in Different Contexts

Edge comes from many sources. Here's how to think about it:

### **Archetype Edge**
Your character type gives Edge when you're acting in your primary mode:
- **Shieldbearer**: +1-2 when protecting others or holding a line
- **Silentknife**: +1-2 when acting from surprise or manipulation
- **Songbearer**: +1-2 when influencing through performance or story
- **Patternweaver**: +1-2 when you've had time to prepare or analyze

### **Domain Edge**
Acting within your specialized Domain gives Edge:
- **Martial**: +1-2 in direct combat or command situations
- **Covert**: +1-2 in intelligence, infiltration, or information warfare
- **Economic**: +1-2 in trade, logistics, or resource management
- **Spiritual**: +1-2 in rituals, faith-based actions, or community leadership
- **Magic/Tech**: +1-2 in Monument interfacing, artifact use, or subparticle manipulation

### **Tree Edge**
Your progression Tree nodes give Edge in specific contexts:
- **"Weapon Specialist"**: +1 with your chosen weapon type
- **"Regional Factor"**: +2 when negotiating trade in your known region
- **"Counter-Intel Nose"**: +1 when detecting spies or infiltrators

### **Situational Edge**
The fiction provides Edge (or penalties):
- **Advantage**: +1-3 (surprise, high ground, superior tools, allies helping)
- **Disadvantage**: -1-3 (wounded, darkness, poor tools, rushed)

**Remember:** All of these stack into ONE Edge number. Don't track them separately.

## Common Questions

### **Q: What if I Have +5 Stat Mod and +5 Edge? Isn't that Too easy?**
**A:** High competency characters *should* succeed at standard tasks (Difficulty 12). The GM responds by:
- Raising Difficulty for truly challenging tasks (16-20+)
- Making Position and Effect more important than success/failure
- Introducing complications even on success
- Creating situations where your strength doesn't apply

### **Q: How Do I Know what Stat to use?**
**A:** Ask: "What's actually doing the work in the fiction?"
- Breaking down a door? Body (strength)
- Picking a lock? Reflex (fine motor control)
- Finding the best way to break in? Mind (problem-solving)
- Convincing the guard you belong here? Charm (deception/presence)

### **Q: Can I Stack Multiple Tree bonuses?**
**A:** Only if they all genuinely apply to this specific action. "Weapon Specialist (swords)" and "Arena Proven" both apply if you're dueling with a sword. But generally, you'll only have 1-2 Tree nodes that fit any given roll.

### **Q: What if Players Argue about Edge?**
**A:** The GM has final say, but should listen to player logic. If they make a good fictional argument for why something should help, it probably should. Edge is about representing the story, not rules-lawyering.

## Design Philosophy

This system is designed to:

1. **Keep play fast** — One roll resolves a whole action
2. **Reward narrative thinking** — Fiction determines Edge, not rule-lookup
3. **Make expertise matter** — High stats and good Edge mean reliable success in your niche
4. **Preserve drama** — Even experts face challenges through Position, Effect, and raised Difficulty
5. **Avoid modifier stacking** — Edge is one number, not a calculation puzzle
