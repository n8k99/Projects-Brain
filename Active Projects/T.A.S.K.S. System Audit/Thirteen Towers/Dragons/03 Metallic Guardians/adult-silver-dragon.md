  desc: The dragon magically polymorphs into a humanoid or beast that has a challenge
    rating no higher than its own, or back into its true form. It reverts to its true
    form if it dies. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying is absorbed or borne
    by the new form (the dragon's choice). In a new form, the dragon retains its alignment,
    hit points, Hit Dice, ability to speak, proficiencies, Legendary Resistance, lair
    actions, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores, as well as this action.

    except any class features or legendary actions of that form.

    half its flying speed.
