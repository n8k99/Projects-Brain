# Character Creation - The Thirteen Towers

## Overview

Character creation in The Thirteen Towers is a structured process that grounds your character in the world of [[Orbis]] before play begins. You'll make choices about culture, background, archetype, and starting competencies that immediately tie you to specific locations, factions, and tensions on the map.

## Character Creation Steps

### Step 1: Concept & Culture

**Choose your character concept and cultural origin.**

Your culture determines:
- Physical and social context (what people expect of you)
- Starting language(s)
- Cultural background options
- Typical stat tendencies (optional guidance, not mandatory)

**Available Cultures:**
- [[Dail Human]] (diverse, adaptable, widespread)
- [[Celanthari]] High Elves (ancient, ritualistic, long-view planning)
- [[Dwarvish|Zhulmar Dwarves]] (mountain-hold, clan-bound, traditional)
- [[Khazadur Dwarven]] (cosmopolitan, trading, diplomatic)
- [[Etrivalian|Nomadic Peoples]] (steppe tribes, seasonal migration, oral tradition)
- Mixed Heritage (choose two cultures, navigate between worlds)
	- [[Halfling]]
	- [[Yotunn Giants]]
- [[Lothian (Dark Elfish) Spirits]]
- [[Elfish]]

**Questions to answer:**
- Where were you born? (Specific province/realm/territory)
- What do people assume about you based on appearance/accent?
- What cultural expectation do you struggle with most?

### Step 2: Generate Base Stats

**Roll or assign stats using one of these methods:**

#### Method A: Standard Array
Assign these values to your 8 stats as you prefer:
**14, 12, 12, 10, 10, 8, 8, 6**

#### Method B: Point Buy (27 points)
- Stats start at 8
- Raising to 9-13 costs 1 point per increase
- Raising to 14-15 costs 2 points per increase
- Maximum starting stat: 15 (before cultural/background modifiers)

#### Method C: Rolling
Roll 2d6+3 for each stat in order, then swap any two.

**The Eight Stats:**

| Stat | Abbreviation | Governs |
|------|--------------|---------|
| **Body** | BOD | Raw strength, endurance, physical power |
| **Reflex** | REF | Speed, agility, reaction time, fine motor control |
| **Charm** | CHM | Persuasion, presence, social influence |
| **Sense** | SEN | Perception, awareness, reading situations |
| **Spirit** | SPR | Willpower, conviction, resistance to mental influence |
| **Mind** | MND | Intellect, memory, reasoning, analysis |
| **Luck** | LCK | Fortune, synchronicity, improbable success |
| **Will** | WIL | Determination, grit, pushing through adversity |

**Calculate Stat Modifiers:**
- Stat 6-7: -2
- Stat 8-9: -1
- Stat 10-11: 0
- Stat 12-13: +1
- Stat 14-15: +2
- Stat 16-17: +3
- Stat 18+: +4

### Step 7: Select Starting Tree Node

### Step 8: Equipment & Resources

**Starting Wealth:** 50 silver coins (or equivalent in trade goods)

**Starting Equipment Package (choose one):**

### Step 9: Determine Starting Resources

**Hit Points (HP):**
- Base HP = 10 + (Body modifier × 2)
- Minimum HP: 8

**Resolve:**
- Base Resolve = 3 + (Spirit or Will modifier, whichever is higher)
- Minimum Resolve: 3
- Used for: Pushing through, resisting mental/moral pressure, activating special abilities

**Defense:**
- Base Defense = 10 + Reflex modifier + armor bonus
- Light armor: +1
- Medium armor: +2
- Heavy armor: +3
- Shield: +1 (requires hand free)

---

### Step 10: Establish Connections & Moral Profile

**Connections (choose 2-3):**
Who matters to you and why?
- Mentor/teacher from your Background
- Family member or clan connection
- Rival or enemy (complicated relationship)
- Faction or organization you're tied to
- Debt owed or obligation held

**Moral Profile:**
Define 2-3 principles your character holds:
- What won't you compromise on? (Moral Weight 3)
- What matters but you might bend? (Moral Weight 2)
- What you prefer but can violate? (Moral Weight 1)

**Examples:**
- "Protect the innocent" (Weight 3)
- "Honor clan traditions" (Weight 2)
- "Prefer honest dealing" (Weight 1)

Acting against these principles triggers **Moral Friction** - increased Difficulty on rolls.

**Name:** Choose a name appropriate to your culture

**Age:** Typical adventuring age ranges by culture:

**Appearance:** Brief description focusing on:

**Starting Location:** Where does your story begin?

- GM may specify based on campaign start

**Short-term Goal:** What are you trying to accomplish right now?
