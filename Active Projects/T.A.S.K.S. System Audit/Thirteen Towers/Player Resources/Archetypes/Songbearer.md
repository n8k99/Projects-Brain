# Songbearer
## The Story-Weaver

---

> *"The story outlives the sword. The song shapes more than the throne. I carry the narrative, and the narrative shapes reality."*

---

## Core Philosophy

The Songbearer's power lies in **narrative itself**—stories, songs, performances, and cultural memory. You understand that reality is shaped by how people **remember** and **interpret** events, not just by what actually happened.

This archetype isn't about entertainment—it's about **weaponizing meaning**.

### What Drives a Songbearer?

**Narrative as Power**: The right story can topple kingdoms
- How events are remembered matters more than the events themselves
- Public perception is a battlefield
- Symbols and stories move masses

**Cultural Stewardship**: You carry what must be remembered
- Traditions preserved through your retelling
- Truths encoded in song and story
- The past speaks through you to the present

**Performance as Truth**: The telling matters as much as the tale
- How you present shapes what people believe
- Presence and charisma make ideas real
- The messenger is part of the message

---

### Shaping Narrative

### Performance & Presence
- **Public performances** before audiences
- **Inspiring groups** through song, speech, or ritual
- **Demoralizing enemies** by undermining their narrative

### Memory Work

- **Recovering lost stories** that matter to the present
- **Witnessing** important events for future telling

## Songbearer Dilemmas

### Truth vs Meaning

**The Core Tension**: Sometimes the **true** story is less meaningful than the **false** one.

Example: The heroic general was actually a coward, but his legend inspires thousands.

Do you:
- Preserve the inspiring legend (meaningful but false)
- Reveal the truth (accurate but demoralizing)
- Craft a third narrative (find truth that still inspires)

**Moral Friction**: Depends on principles—"truth above all" vs "meaning sustains communities"

### Weaponizing Narrative

**The Propagandist's Dilemma**: Your stories can start wars, topple rulers, incite violence.

Are you responsible for **how your stories are used**?

**Songbearer Philosophy**: Vary by character
- "I'm just the messenger" (abdication of responsibility)
- "I choose my stories carefully" (strategic responsibility)
- "I bear witness; consequences are others' choice" (chronicle perspective)

### The Silenced Story

**The Suppression Question**: Someone powerful wants a story **erased**.

If you tell it:
- People deserve truth
- You risk everything
- The story might cause harm

If you suppress it:
- You betray your archetype
- Truth dies with your silence
- But people might be protected

**Moral Friction**: Core Betrayal (+6) to suppress truth—but consequences might justify it.

### Performance vs Authenticity

**The Entertainer's Trap**: Are you a **truth-teller** or a **performer**?

When performance demands change truth for better story, **what do you do**?

Songbearers must navigate:
- Embellishment (making story compelling)
- Distortion (changing facts for narrative impact)
- Fabrication (inventing "truth")

**Where's the line?**

---

## Songbearer Philosophy

### Narrative Shapes Reality

**Core Belief**: What people **believe** happened is more powerful than what **actually** happened.

Example:
- The battle was lost, but the story says "heroic last stand"
- Result: Morale preserved, recruits inspired, defeat becomes legend

**Songbearers understand**: Control the narrative, control the consequences.

### The Story Outlives the Sword

**Long-Term Thinking**: Empires fall, but stories endure.

Songbearers play the **long game**:
- Armies win battles today
- Stories shape civilizations for generations

**Your legacy**: Not what you did, but what **stories you left behind**.

### Witness as Responsibility

**Bearing Witness**: Someone must remember and tell what happened.

Songbearers carry the **burden of memory**:
- The forgotten deserve to be remembered
- Silence enables erasure
- Witnessing is activism

**The weight**: You carry stories of atrocity, loss, and injustice—and must retell them.

## Songbearer and Draconic Attention

**Low Risk**: Cultural stories, entertainment, traditional narratives

- Revealing Monument "magic" as technology

**High Risk** (+6-8 Severity):
- Revealing Earth/Colony truth through performance
- Creating civilizational narratives that reject Dragon administration
- Spreading Truth through song (unstoppable once started)

**Songbearer Advantage**: Stories spread **organically**—Dragons can silence the storyteller, but not the story.

**Songbearer Danger**: Your stories might outlive you—even if Dragons kill you, the narrative spreads.
