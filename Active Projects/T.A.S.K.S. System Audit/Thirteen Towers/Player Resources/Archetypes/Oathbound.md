# Oathbound
## The Word-Keeper

---

> *"My word is my bond. I swear it, I keep it. This is the only honor that matters."*

---

## Core Philosophy

The Oathbound's identity is defined by **commitment made manifest**. Your sworn word creates binding reality—promises aren't suggestions, they're **obligations**.

This isn't about blind obedience. It's about **integrity**—being the same person in shadow and light, keeping your word even when inconvenient.

### What Drives an Oathbound?

**Word as Sacred**: Promises shape reality through commitment
- Sworn oaths are binding contracts with reality itself
- Your reputation is built on consistent word-keeping
- Breaking your word breaks **you**

**Honor as Structure**: Codes and principles create order
- Formal rules provide clarity in chaos
- Honor codes are **chosen** constraints
- Discipline and tradition have deep value

**Trust as Currency**: Relationships built on reliable commitment
- Others can depend on you absolutely
- Your word creates certainty in uncertain world
- Betrayal of trust is worse than death

## Oathbound Dilemmas

### The Conflicting Oaths Problem

**Classic Dilemma**: Two sworn oaths contradict.

Example:
- Oath to protect your lord
- Oath to serve justice
- Your lord committed murder

**Which oath wins?**

**Resolution Paths**:
1. **Hierarchy**: Predetermined oath priority
2. **Renegotiate**: Try to satisfy both (creative solution)
3. **Break Lesser**: Accept consequences
4. **Break Self**: Character transformation (become Oathbreaker)

**Moral Friction**: Severe (+4 or +6) regardless of choice.

### The Unjust Oath

**Dilemma**: You swore to do something that's now clearly wrong.

Example: Sworn to serve a ruler who's become a tyrant.

**Options**:
- **Keep oath** (honor over morality)
- **Break oath** (morality over honor)
- **Reinterpret** (letter vs spirit)
- **Release** (seek formal release from oath)

**Oathbound Philosophy**: Varies
- Absolutist: "I keep oaths, period"
- Principled: "Spirit matters more than letter"
- Pragmatic: "I can be released from unjust oaths"

### The Impossible Promise

**Dilemma**: You swore to do something that's becoming impossible.

Example: Promised to protect someone who's deliberately walking into death.

**Moral Friction**: Failing oath despite best effort
- No Friction if you tried everything
- +4 Friction if you gave up too easily
- +6 Friction if you didn't try

**Key**: Oathbound are judged on **effort**, not just results.

### The Oath to Evil

**Dilemma**: Someone evil demands your oath.

If you swear and keep it: You're honor-bound to evil
If you swear and break it: You're an oathbreaker
If you refuse: They might kill you or someone you protect

**What do you do?**

**Oathbound Solutions**:
- Never swear oaths to evil (wisdom)
- Swear with loopholes (pragmatism)
- Accept death rather than oath to evil (absolutism)

---

## Oathbound Philosophy

### The Oath as Sacred Contract

**Core Belief**: Promises create binding reality.

When Oathbound swear:
- They're not **saying** they'll do something
- They're **making it true** that they will

**Oaths are performative**—the speaking makes it so.

### Honor as Identity

**You ARE your word**. Breaking it breaks you.

Oathbound don't keep promises because it's **convenient**—they keep them because **not keeping them destroys who they are**.

**Identity Preservation**: Keeping your word maintains your sense of self.

### Trust as Foundation

**Society runs on trust**. Oathbound are **reliable points** in uncertain world.

When everything else is uncertain:
- Oathbound keep their word
- Contracts with them hold
- Their promises create certainty

This makes them **invaluable** in diplomacy, command, commerce, law.

## Oathbound and Draconic Attention

**Generally Low Risk**: Honor and oaths don't threaten Dragons

**Moderate Risk** (+2-4):
- Oaths that create powerful political coalitions
- Binding treaties that shift realm power
- Sworn resistance to Dragon authority

**High Risk** (+6-8):
- Oath to reveal or protect Earth/Colony truth
- Sworn protection of individuals Dragons want eliminated
- Honor code that rejects Dragon authority

**Oathbound Tragedy**: If you swear to resist Dragons, **you must keep that oath**—even if it's suicidal.

That's the price of being Oathbound.
