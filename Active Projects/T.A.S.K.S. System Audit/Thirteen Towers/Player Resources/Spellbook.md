## Monument-Attuned Casting on Orbis

---

## What is "Magic" on Orbis?

On the surface, magic appears to be traditional fantasy sorcery: gestures, words of power, mystical effects manifesting from nothing.

**The Truth**: "Spellcasting" is **remote Monument interface technology**. When you "cast," you're:
- Wirelessly accessing Monument network nodes
- Manipulating quantum fields through neural interface
- Commanding nanite swarms in the environment
- Triggering pre-programmed Colony fabrication protocols

**But it FEELS like magic** - and that's intentional. The Dragons designed it that way.

## How Spellcasting Works

### Monument Attunement

To cast spells, you must be **Monument-Attuned**:
- **Requires**: Magic/Tech Domain at Journeyman+ in Monument Research tree
- **Represents**: Neural interface with Monument network (either genetic marker or acquired augmentation)
- **Limitation**: Works within Monument network range (most settled areas)

### Casting Mechanics

**To Cast a Spell**:
1. Declare which spell you're casting
2. Roll **Mind + Edge vs Difficulty** (spell-dependent)
3. Success: Spell manifests as described
4. Failure: Spell fizzles OR backfires (GM's call based on Position)

**Spell Slots**: You can cast **Mind modifier + Magic/Tech tier** spells per day before exhaustion
- MND 14 (+2) + Journeyman Magic/Tech (2) = **4 spells per day**
- Pushing beyond this: Each additional spell requires SPR save (Difficulty 12, +2 per spell beyond limit) or take 1d6 psychic damage

**Spell Lists**: Characters know spells based on their research and training
- Start with 3 spells (chosen during character creation)
- Learn 1 new spell per Magic/Tech tree node advancement
- Can learn from scrolls, mentors, or Monument archives

# The Truth About "Magic"

## What Players Believe (Surface)
- Magic is ancient, mysterious power
- Spells are taught through tradition
- Gestures and words channel mystical energy
- Power comes from the caster's will

## What's Actually Happening (Reality)
- You're interfacing with Monument network via genetic/acquired neural link
- "Gestures" are biometric authentication
- "Words of power" are voice-activated security protocols
- Effects are nanite swarms, energy fields, quantum manipulation
- Power draw comes from Monument network, not caster

## When Players Learn the Truth
High-tier Magic/Tech specialists discover:
- Spells are **programmed functions**
- "Learning" a spell is **downloading the protocol**
- Spell slots are **network bandwidth limitations**
- Counterspell is **signal jamming**
- The Dragons can **cut your access** if you're a threat

This realization can be devastating or empowering, depending on the character.
