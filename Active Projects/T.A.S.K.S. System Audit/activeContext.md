# Active Context — T.A.S.K.S. System Audit

## PROBLEM

T.A.S.K.S. has six installed skills (agent-chronicle, reflect-learn, self-reflection, agentic-compass, proactive-agent, soulcraft) but no integrated behavioral framework. Without real work to generate performance data, any self-assessment would produce false positives.

Need: Real work that tests capabilities, decision-making, and integration of all six skills simultaneously.

## APPROACH

Use **Thirteen Towers Gaming System** as the vehicle for self-assessment and skill integration:

1. **Real work context** — Foundry VTT system at 0.9.0 (Late Alpha), needs completion within 2 weeks
2. **Skill integration test** — Work diary (agent-chronicle), reflection on decisions (reflect-learn), pattern avoidance (self-reflection), performance measurement (agentic-compass), proactive ideation (proactive-agent), identity/principles (soulcraft)
3. **Authentic performance data** — Complete game system, working automation, tested mechanics = measurable output
4. **Self-assessment loop** — Daily diary → reflection → performance measurement → encoding learnings → next iteration

## BLOCKERS

None. All systems operational (FD leak cleared, gateway restarted).

## DECISIONS

**Decision 1:** Use Thirteen Towers as subproject of this audit
- Reason: Real work requirement for valid self-assessment
- Impact: Thirteen Towers becomes centerpiece of agent-improvement cycle

**Decision 2:** Two-week timeline for Thirteen Towers v1.0 completion
- Reason: Matches self-assessment window; provides hard deadline for real performance measurement
- Impact: Focus on functional automation + compendiums, not endless polish

**Decision 3:** Full skill integration during this project
- Reason: Only way to know if skills work together in practice
- Impact: Daily diary + reflection mandatory, not optional

## RECENT DECISIONS

- Moved Thirteen Towers from Archive into T.A.S.K.S. System Audit subproject folder
- Gateway restarted (cleared FD leak)
- Established this project as the locus of work for next 2 weeks

## NEXT IMMEDIATE STEPS

1. Create Thirteen Towers/activeContext.md (define Foundry system v1.0 scope)
2. Create Thirteen Towers/decisionLog.md (start capturing design decisions)
3. Read Thirteen Towers/README.md fully to understand current state
4. Map remaining work to 2-week timeline (identify critical path)
5. Start first diary entry for agent-chronicle (capture initial state, today's discoveries)
