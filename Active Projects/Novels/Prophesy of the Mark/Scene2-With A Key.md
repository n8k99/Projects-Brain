# 2

The Mine Bell rang its final note, and the spell over Hatfield broke like ice under strain. Sound seeped back into the streets: wagon wheels creaking as the caravan still wound up the road, traders calling to one another as they swung open their doors and found no eager crowds waiting. Instead, the town’s people moved in a slow, silent current toward the Main Square, drawn by habit, fear, and something older than either.

Seldiesal spotted her husband and their son, Aethel, emerging from the tavern with instruments still in hand. They had been readying themselves to play for the noon meal, to trade songs for coin and distraction. She caught Lyra’s hand and steered them across the shifting flow of dwarves, angling for the square so they could reach the other half of their family.

Rielan Sol‑astra wrapped an arm across her shoulders as they met, his height and elven build towering over the stocky locals. The familiar weight of his hand did little to ease the cold knot forming beneath Seldiesal’s ribs. They had fled worse scenes once already—fled a dragon’s corpse and the sudden collapse of a delicate understanding. The gold they had studied and sung for had died a continent away under spears and politics twenty‑five years ago, a shock neither of them had foreseen, not even with Seldiesal’s gift for glimpsing worldtracks. They had built a quieter life here in the Riellis Mountains, on the glacier’s edge, as if distance and mundane routine could keep such forces at bay.

Now, as the people of Hatfield filed toward the bell and the great mine doors, the same tension coiled in the air. It felt like standing again at the moment before scales hit stone and everything changed.

The elves and their children seemed to be the only surface folk not wholly bent beneath the bell’s compulsion. All around them, the dwarves of Hatfield moved with the same trance‑like focus, as though some deep cultural command—half magic, half drilled obedience to Zhulmar’s authority—had been triggered by the sound. To Seldiesal, it underscored a truth she usually managed to ignore: after twenty‑five years here, they were still outsiders to the Dominion’s oldest rites.

The caravaners, too, were immune in their way. They followed in a loose ring at the back, not compelled but curious, forming a cordon of fur cloaks and travel‑scarred faces behind the cluster of villagers. Rimthalien Aloevan, the trade group’s leader, walked with arms folded and jaw tight, already weighing how long he could afford this delay before the Infernal Route’s schedule began to fray.

At the far side of the square, the massive doors of the Grand Mine Entrance had finished their slow, majestic swing inward. Beyond them yawned a great black throat in the mountainside, the hidden shaft that connected Hatfield not to the shallow copper levels its own miners worked, but to the deeper veins and deeper politics of the Zhulmar Dominion. The glacier that cradled the village rested on those old decisions like a thin blanket over buried mechanisms.

From somewhere within that darkness came the steady clomp of boots marching in time, a sound shaped by stone into a drumbeat. A horn’s harsh call blared down the tunnel, slicing through the last threads of the crowd’s silence. Murmurs rose as dwarves glanced at each other, checking that their neighbors’ faces reflected the same alarm and unease as their own.

A squad of deep‑mine troops emerged from the shadows, their armor darker and finer than the surface guards’, embossed with symbols Seldiesal recognized only from second‑hand stories: ruby‑inset circles of authority, the abstracted anvil‑crown of Forge King Meganum Drulmor. They marched to the threshold and halted on some unseen command. Orders were barked in the clipped cadence of the Deep, then two soldiers stepped back into the tunnel and reappeared escorting a third dwarf between them.

This one’s wrists were bound together before him with light iron. His leathers were better cut than most Hatfield miners’, reinforced in ways that suggested both rank and frequent use. His cloak was thrown back, exposing broad shoulders roped with muscle from years at the face. Even after living among dwarves for a quarter century, Seldiesal still needed time to sort their individual features; beard shapes and braids blurred together until familiarity fixed them. Yet even from a distance, this one struck her as different. Not handsome, not obviously charismatic, but carrying a certain rawness.

He was bearded, as all dwarves were, and short and stocky like the rest, but there was something untamed about him, an edge that the deep‑mine discipline had not quite ground smooth. His posture suggested a coiled reluctance standing hard against a stubborn choice already made.

At the threshold, the escort halted. One guard produced a key and, with ceremonial care, unlocked the irons. The chain fell away. The troop captain stepped forward to stand just inside the doors, turning to face the gathered town. His voice, when he spoke, rolled out with the resonance of someone accustomed to reciting decrees in under‑halls.

“Above the foundations laid by Forge King Meganum Drulmor,” he intoned, “by decree of the Ruby Circle, under the verdict of the Ember Trial, and at the petition of Durnek Bravone, Forgemaster of House Bravone—witness the separation of this Soulcrusher from the Dominion below. By his own will, he seeks a name upon the surface of Orbis.”

The titles landed like hammer blows. Forge King Drulmor’s name drew a murmur; everyone in Hatfield knew their surface existence persisted only because the Forge King wished to reach upward. The Ruby Circle—those distant advisors who spoke for the King in countless small towns like this—usually acted far from public sight. For them to be named aloud meant their eyes were on this moment. And the Ember Trial, whispered of in taverns as a half‑mythic test dwarves could demand when the law pressed too hard, turned whispers into reality. Somewhere below, this dwarf had invoked a rite old enough to be carved into Zhulmar’s first support stones, gambling his place in the Dominion on a chance at something else.

The Bravone name stirred another, subtler ripple. Some in Hatfield had heard it before, attached to rumors of one of Zhulmar’s great forging houses, a lineage tangled up in the ancient War of Ash and Iron and the Soulcrushers who had walked that conflict’s front lines. Most only knew that when deep‑mine officials spoke of Bravones, their mouths went thin and their eyes watched the corners of rooms.

Now, one of that line stood blinking in Hatfield’s cold light.

The two guards gave him a firm shove, pushing him a pace into the open, then stepped smartly back into their ranks. The crowd inhaled as one. The dwarf squinted up at the blank winter sky, eyes adjusting, jaw tight. He flexed his freed hands once, rubbing at the marks the cuffs had left.

Durni Trueblood finally seemed to realize that this was his moment. He hurried forward from the side of the square, chest puffed, and raised his voice in a way that was meant to sound official and instead cracked around the edges.

“We, ah, do accept the responsibility… um… expected in possession of this prisoner,” he declared. “Sergeant, collect him.”

He turned to glare meaningfully at Riminion Helcral, who had been drawing a deep breath to issue his own orders.

The captain of the deep‑mine troops looked slowly from Durni to the newly freed dwarf, then back. His expression did not change, but his tone cooled.

“You have been on the surface too long, Overseer,” he said. “The Ember Trial is voluntary separation from the Zhulmar Dominion. This dwarf is no more a prisoner than you.”

A ripple of talk slid through the crowd at that. Ember Trial stories had painted it as a thing of desperate dwarves and ancient grudges. To hear a captain name it so plainly, and to see the result standing in front of them, made it real in a way no tavern tale ever had.

Durni’s face flushed a deep, unhealthy shade of red. “Ah—of course. Thank you for… the reminder,” he sputtered. “It is so rarely requested, and who can believe all the old stories, eh?” He laughed weakly. No one joined him. “But we are glad to do our part on the surface.”

The captain’s shoulders had tensed during Durni’s ramble, but at those last words he relaxed by a fraction, as if a minor protocol had finally been satisfied. “There is nothing you need to do,” he replied. “The Trial is not for you.”

He turned slightly, attention shifting back to the dwarf at the threshold. In that moment, the younger dwarf stepped closer, extending a hand in a gesture that was not quite a salute and not quite a plea. The captain blinked, as if suddenly remembering a duty almost overlooked, then reached to his own belt. He drew a broad, well‑kept axe from its loop and reversed it, offering the haft.

The dwarf took it with care, fingers tightening around a grip that clearly fit him. He weighed the weapon once, testing its balance, then slung it across his back where it settled into a familiar groove. Without fanfare, he turned to face the square fully for the first time.

Seldiesal studied his face now that the beards and shadows were at a better angle. Younger than some she treated, older than many of the raw‑boned miners. There was hardness there, the kind that comes from long shifts and longer arguments, but also a flicker of something else behind his eyes—hurt, perhaps, wrapped tight around a stubborn resolve not to show it.

He cleared his throat, the sound small in the open space. When he spoke, his voice carried clearly enough for the bell‑ring quiet of the moment.

“Which way,” he asked, “to the Roadmarker of Sundering?”

The question hit the crowd like a dropped stone. Gasps, low exclamations, and a susurrus of hurried whispering spread outward in a wave. The Roadmarker was no ordinary border stone. Every child in Hatfield knew at least one story of the obsidian monolith standing out in the High Nook Valley where Zhulmar’s claim ended and the Coalition of Etrivalian Tribes began. Its faces were carved with sigils from ages when dwarven Soulcrushers and steppe champions had carved their marks there before marching into wars that reshaped Orbis.

To say you meant to walk there was to say you meant to leave the Dominion’s tunnels entirely and step out onto the Infernal Route as one more wanderer at the mercy of tundra, caravans, and bandits. To say it as your first words as an Ember‑Tried exile was something else again.

Everyone seemed to look in a different direction at once. Hands rose, fingers pointing west, north‑west, back toward the High Nook Valley’s snow‑choked trails, or down toward the road that would eventually bend to the Rarhoci River. It was as if the town’s collective mind had shattered into a dozen slightly different maps of the same route.

The dwarf—Korrallan, Seldiesal thought, remembering the name tied to Bravone in rumors—let his gaze travel over the flurry of gestures. He seemed to make an internal calculation, weighing the tangle of advice against some simpler, inner compass. Then he nodded once.

He stepped forward into the corridor of surface guards. Riminion’s soldiers, who had been holding themselves rigid out of habit and uncertainty, parted for him without needing an order. When he reached Durni Trueblood, the Overseer found himself quite physically in the way, planted squarely in the center of the passage.

For a heartbeat, Korrallan simply looked at him. It was not a dramatic stare, not an attempt at intimidation. It was an assessment, cool and measuring, from someone who had spent his life taking the measure of rock faces and foremen alike. Whatever he saw there made his eyes harden by a shade.

Durni flinched first, stepping aside with a little hop. As Korrallan moved past, the Overseer scrambled to recover his sense of control with words.

“The Roadmarker?” Durni blurted. “What would you want that for? It is too far. You will never make it—not in this season. We have a place for you here. If you prove to be a good digger, in a couple of seasons you could head up a team. A Bravone leading surface crews in Hatfield would be—”

Korrallan stopped. He did not turn back. He stood there, back to the Overseer, as the entire burg of Hatfield held its breath. Even the caravaners, who did not yet know why the Bravone name mattered, could feel that whatever he was about to say would carry weight.

When the words came, they were quiet, but they cut through Durni’s patter like a sharp chisel.

“I am walking away from a position I was born into,” he said, “that you will never reach through all your preening and posturing. Do you think I will trade that for whatever you are offering?”

Durni’s mouth snapped shut. No one laughed, but the air seemed to shift as people marked the Overseer’s deflation and the exile’s refusal in the same moment. Korrallan resumed walking.

The crowd parted ahead of him as if pressed by invisible hands, then closed again in his wake. Some dwarves reached out to touch his shoulder or sleeve as he passed, as if uncertain whether to offer blessing or ward themselves against his fate.

Grasping at what he thought was inspiration, Durni called after him, “Who can show this dwarf where the kobolds are ranging? Perhaps he would like to know that!”

The mention of kobolds sparked another ripple. The caravan’s complaint was still fresh. High Nook Valley’s stretch of the Infernal Route had been dangerous even before some bandit gang organized enough to harass full caravans. Now, the idea of a lone dwarf, even a Bravone, walking out into that felt wrong.

Korrallan did not pause. He kept moving through the hush, boots crunching on packed snow and grit. The kobold threat did not seem to change his trajectory.

From the back of the crowd, a voice with the crisp consonants of the trade roads rang out. “I’ll be glad to show him.”

People shifted, turning to locate the speaker. A lane opened through the crush, bodies stepping aside as if pushed by the force of curiosity alone. At the far end, framed by wagon wheels and bundled merchants, stood a human woman with dark hair and a smirk that didn’t quite reach her sharp, assessing eyes.

Vanya Sol, Seldiesal remembered—one of the caravan’s rogues, though the word meant more scholar‑thief than cutpurse in her case. She had passed through Hatfield before, following rumors of ruins and lost books in the High Nook Valley, the kind of tales that also drew the Consortium of Whispers’ diggers farther north. If anyone in this square knew the old paths toward the Roadmarker and the hazards along them, it would be someone like her.

Korrallan adjusted his path by a few degrees, angling toward the new line of travel that had opened. Before he could reach Vanya, two more voices spoke up at Seldiesal’s side—voices she knew as well as her own breath.

“I’ll go with him,” Aethel said, the words tumbling out as if he’d been holding them behind his teeth since the bell first rang.

“Aye,” Lyra added, almost on top of him. “Me too.”

Seldiesal’s heart lurched. Pride and dread collided in her chest so hard it felt like a physical blow. She had always known that Hatfield could not hold the twins forever. Aethel’s songs had grown too full of distant horizons. Lyra’s notebooks were dense with questions the glacier could not answer. Still, she had hoped for more time than a single afternoon.

Before she could speak, the twins were already moving, slipping through gaps in the dwarven ranks with the easy grace of long‑limbed elves among shorter folk. They stepped into the space between Korrallan and Vanya, matching his pace without quite crowding him. The dwarf glanced at them, at their instruments and staff and uncertain, determined faces, then turned his eyes forward again and kept walking.

Their shoulders hunched slightly as they fell in behind him, as if the reality of their impulsive choice had just caught up with them. Both looked back once, scanning the crowd with expressions that mingled excitement with the dawning awareness that the path ahead led far beyond familiar trails.

Rielan reacted before Seldiesal’s limbs remembered how to move. He sprinted away from her side, cutting through back alleys toward their nearby home. Korrallan’s little procession continued toward the western edge of town, the crowd thinning there where the cobbles gave way to hard‑packed track.

Just as the trio reached the point where Hatfield’s buildings fell away and the High Nook Valley’s wind began to bite, Rielan reappeared, breath steaming in short bursts, a pack slung over each shoulder. He pushed through the last knot of villagers and thrust one bundle into each twin’s hands.

The packs were not grand. A change of clothes, a few days’ rations, bedrolls and simple tools, a small pouch of coin each—everything Seldiesal and Rielan had quietly set aside over years of half‑expecting this day. When Aethel felt the weight in his grasp, his posture straightened. When Lyra’s fingers closed around the strap, some of the panic in her eyes steadied into focus. The gesture carried more permission than any blessing Seldiesal could have spoken aloud in that moment.

From where she stood, Seldiesal watched her children receive those packs and felt tears prick hot at the corners of her eyes. Her heart broke at the thought of them stepping into dangers she could not see clearly yet, and danced with fierce joy at the sight of them finally walking toward a wider world than Hatfield’s square. Above them all, unseen and unremarked for now, the worldtracks SylEshis would someday show to Korrallan shifted by a fraction, acknowledging three more figures joining the line that led toward the Roadmarker of Sundering and beyond.
