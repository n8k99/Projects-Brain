"Just like that, the conversation is over?" Lyra heatedly hurried after the dwarf. "You tell us that this mysterious cleric is a member of a draconic cult, and claim that they are ruining the culture of the dwarfs, and that is that? Incredible." She had caught up to his lumbering form as he carried the copper ingot along the trail beside the river.

Korralan, glancing at her before setting his eyes once again on the road ahead, grunted. 

"Can we get more out of you than grunts?" She was getting visibly frustrated. "It will greatly help us understand you as more than some mysterious dwarf who appeared in our village two days ago and had some weird quest he just had to go on."

"She's right," Aethel had caught up with them, "We are glad to be out here and to help, but this is starting to be a situation where we need some more, well, give us some of your story."

"Story?" This puzzled the former miner. "What do you mean story? There are no stories about me."

"We all have stories about us. We carry them around inside of us." The young bard's tone lightened and warmed, "They are what makes us, well, us. They are composed of our thoughts and our feelings. We all have a past, a history, where we have been, what we have done, the things we choose to believe. These are all part of our story."

Vanya had closed up to the rest and now chimed in, "We can all look at others and tell a bit about them from the way they carry themselves, how they are dressed, the way they talk. Much like you could tell that cleric was from the Emberborn."

"So we all know that you are not just some dwarf who happened to be going for a little walk." Lyra seemed more relieved to have assistance trying to crack this taciturn shell. "This land is harsh, harsher than I suppose the deep mines were for you. As we have already seen, there are desperate folks out here and it will be helpful to have friends and allies helping you on you quest. We are just asking for a little more from you than grunts."

Shifting the weight of the ingot on his back, Korralan heaved a sigh. "I see what you are saying. You have made quite an effort to join me, and things like the Emberborn and the danger that they represent, I need to explain more."

"That would be a good start." Aethel beamed.

"Please forgive me, my experiences, as you put them, have shown me that everyone is out to get something from you to benefit only themselves. This is perhaps because I am a Soulcrusher."

"Which we also have no idea what that is?" Aethel gently prodded. 

The whole party began to slow a bit as the path by the river began to rise, even as the flowing water cut deeper into the banks. There were fewer birds about dotting the horizon and the sun had elevated itself high into the sky.

"I am, was, responsible for making sure that the mines were running smoothly. I encouraged miners to dig deeper each day. I consulted with engineers about the best way to construct the tunnels, and I ordered supplies from smiths to keep them working. I also helped train the smiths in my portion of the mine. It was a position my family bestowed upon me." Korralan then paused as he finished mounting a rise in the path that seemed to level out.

"Then you are a noble." Vanya observed, "Anyone could tell that by looking at you."

"Yes, I am from an old but minor house in the Dominion." Now that he was finally opening up, Korralan felt a rush of words ready to leap upon his tongue and spring forth. "We do not sit in the Ruby Circle, which is what we call the advisors to the Forge King. However, we do control some important resources. So lots of dwarfs are trying to get something from me."

"And these Emberborn, are they part of that?" Lyra swetened her tone to encourage him to keep sharing.

Up ahead of them there was jutting rock which seemed close but even though they had been heading in its general direction for quite a while, it did not appear to be any closer. Korralan fixed his eyes upon it and the mountains whicch loomed on the horizon behind it. "There are more dwarfs now who have fallen into their way of thinking. Which is very dangerous." Another heavy sigh and the weight on his back shifted once more. "But this goes back to the War of Ash and Iron, when we drove Ignarath to another plane."

Aeethel sputtered and choked as he tried to respond to this, "Drove an ancient red dragon to another plane!?! What? I mean, there are tales and epics about the Scortched Tyrant but they all talk about him being killed or going in to his lair to hide."

"Those are the stories which folks like the Emberborn spread as they try to make it seem like his was not all the bad." A forlorn expression briefly crossd the dwarf's face, "They are lies and those who worship him want him to return and make life here *great again.*" With his final words, Korralan's expression darkened and once again he grew quiet. His jaw set in a way that the other three could tell that he was not going to open up again until whatever it was that he was feeling began to loosen its hold over his heart.

As the minutes passed, the path they had been following curved gently away from the river which was now below them. In an instance, the jutting rock was suddenly before them. At its base was the remaining walls of a stone bastion. A large force seemed to split the entire structure in several parts. 

"Mother spoke of a great earthquake many, may ears ago that shook this valley. That must have been what happened to this place." Lyra remembered lessons she had received from several seasons ago. "And many of the miners in Hatfield liked to talk about it. They say it is what opened up access to the copper vein beneath the town."

"The Great Sundering Earthquake." Aethel proclaimed quite dramatically while waving his hands into an accompanying flourish. "It was the the movement of both heaven and the mountains beneath our feet! It feeds us even today! Yes, I have heard that story way too many times in my life."

"You can not understand the way it changed the dwarfs of Zhulmar." Korralan's tone was remorseful, as if he were personally affected by the ancient story. "There was a split in the dwarfs at that time, some like the Emberborn say the split came caused the quake."

"Sounds like they like to imagine their own version of history." Vanya observed in a tone that suggested that she would rather have written that observation than speak it. 

"Yes, that is what they specialize in. Lies, Deceit and misinterpretations that serve their purposes." he agreed.

Approaching the ruined structure more details began to emerge, a massive iron door, carvings on the walls, crests which they now recognized as belonging to the Kingdom of Three Peaks which has once ruled on the surface of the valley. There were cracks in some of the walls large enough that they could enter at any point of the remaining structure. The eastern most part of the bastion was a tower that stretched upwards to the sky, it was in fact the jutting rock which they had been navigating towards the whole time. The stonemason who had constructed it used techniques to make it appear to quite a natural landmark and it blended into the terrain as if it had formed there geologically. 

"The Crimson Codex." Korralan quietly spoke. "That is the relic that the cleric is looking for."

Lyra once again looked at him with frustration, "There, that is exactly the sort of thing that you need to explain more of."

"It is a very powerful book of magic and many people have been looking for it a long time." Vanya once again unfurled one of her waiting lectures. "Supposedly compiled by court wizards over a thousand years ago, it has the first translation of draconic, and contains spells which can literally move the earth, reshape the stars and reveals hidden truths about the true nature of this planet. At least that is what I have heard."

"How have you heard about this?" Aethel once again seemed to be the correct foil at expressing amazement.

"Do please remember me telling your sister that I have gotten to see the libraries in the Court of Arcana in the Free City of Myranth." She used a measured clip while thinly smiling at the young elf. "There were lots of people in places like that which would be greatly interested in powerful relics like The Crimson Codex, if it exists."

"The power to move the earth is what the Emberborn seeks." Korralan once again, quickened his step as he headed towards one of the opening in the bastion's walls.
