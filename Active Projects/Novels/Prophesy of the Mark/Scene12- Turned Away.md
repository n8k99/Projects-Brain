Following the dwarf through the hole in the stone wall, Vanya peered about the chamber she had entered. Her first and more dominating sight was Korralan simultaneously being attacked and swatting the newly made corpses of a swarm of rats with the flat of his great axe. Swiftly drawing her rapier as the rodents noticed her arrival and began to encompass her into their defense of the chamber. Poking them swifting and moving on to the next target, her rapier danced and wove chaotic patterns of death. Meanwhile Aethel had now entered the room and joined into what was swiftly become a localized cull of the vermin infestation. As the dead bodies accumulated about the place, the remaining living creatures quickly began to flee the room. Perhaps only temporarily routed into other safer quarters, the room was no longer full of death squeals as Lyra finally came through the opening.

"Oh I see you all have been having a bit of fun without me," She very tongue in cheek joked.

"It's not like we had time to send out invitations," her brother retorted as he was putting his 'borrowed' sword back in its scabbard. "not that you would have accepted it, ye who are of solitary constitution."

Without its defending troops, the room was revealed in the robes of an apparent former treasury. Its thick walls which had been designed to prevent villainous plunder of its content also served to hold it up during and after the ancient earthquake which had caused so much of the remainder of the bastion to be destroyed or at the very least ruined. Vanya was already examining an ancient and ignored lockbox which she had midwifed from an obscured alcove in the wall. One knee down on the floor, she freed a pair of delicate tools from from a hidden pocket within her green leather breeches and concentrated on working them into the mechanism which kept its secrets secured within. On the other side of the room, Aethel was banging at a carved copper plaque that had been propped against the wall. Ancient letters revealed themselves as he knocked layers of encrusted dirt and dust off its surface. 

"What is it with these people and their fascination with Draconic letters?" He exclaimed as efforts seemed to finally yield a legible result. 

"Here dwells the power eternal - Pyrithaxes guards the faithful." Lyra translated aloud, "I think, the words are arcane and antiquated."

"So its old." Aethel was not asking but remarking, then snidely added, "Is there anything that is not old in this world?"

From the next room that was accessed by a door to the north, the sounds of Korralan continuing to swat at the squeaking and squalling swarm of rats could be heard. Then his voice rang out, "Did you say Pyrithaxes?"

A bit ruminatively Lyra responded, "Aye, that is what I said. Is it important?"

More sounds of splatting rodents meeting and end of life, dwarfish grunts and heavy thuds when his axe collided with something more substantial nearly drownd out his shouted response. "Only that was Ignarath's sire."

"Does he know Ignarath's whole genealogical tree?" Aethel uttered under his breathe, his stupefaction nearly complete.

More thuds and bumps and thuds, in a diminishing rhythm closed with the final step of heavy miner's boots in the doorframe. "Nearly every dwarf in the Dominion knows the lineage of our greatest foe." Korralan actually seemed to be enjoying himself in the moment. 

Just in that moment there was an audible click as the locked box which Vanya had been focused on ceased to resist. Carefully, she lifted the lid and peered in at its contents. Then gingerly reached in and scooped up a handful of copper coins. She was about to fold them into her cloak when she realized the rest of the party was watching her. Flipping one of the coins to each of them, she begin to describe what had been found, "These are not regular coppers. They are quite old." There was a dragon on one side and the words **Korvathus Rex** stamped on the other. "If the rumors I heard in Myranth are true, these are at least a thousand years old."Tucking the remaining coins in her inner pockets, she then lifted a scrape of parchment out of the box. At this point she sent the box on the floor and reached for her book and began to copy the text of the parchment. When she finished, she extended her hand in the direction of Lyra who was approaching, "Any idea what this says?"

Taking the deliate scrape from the outstreched hand, Lyra looked at it, "Oh its not as old. So that makes it easier. All we could salvage before the basilisks drove us out. Erasmus believes these coins alone prove the empire's existence. " She handed the parchment back to Vanya who folded it and tucked it into her book. "That does not sound like a very inviting place to me."

"In that case no runes shall be lit in your name" Aethel jested. Then he stood and followed after Korralan wake. 

Through the next room which was actually the remains of a spiral staircase which no longer lead anywhere as the tower which had once been above it was now, at best an unstable pile of rocks . Next to the bottom of the broken staircase stood a creepy statue, no it was actually a giant stuffed sparrow. Aethel's boots crunched on shattered crystal shards all over the floor, absently stroking the sparrow as he passed to follow the dwarf deeper into the ruins. Passing through two different sets of doors which had not survived the great earthquake, he strolled cheerfully into a chamber where Korralan was continuing his solo onslaught against the infestation of rats.. A cool shiver ran down his spine, "Ooh a library. Lyra would love it in here. Wait. Where is Lyra?" As his words hung in the air, Aethel could hear a voice, but not understand what it was whispering to him, nor from where it was coming. 

"What did you say?" Korralan grunted as the rats once again fled from the room to escape the brutal flat of his mighty axe.

"I don't know." Aethel was growing more perplexed at what was happening to him, and could not recall why he was in this room nor what he supposed to do not that he was in here. "My keys, did I leave my keys in here? " 

"Your what?" The dwarf stopped and stared directly in Aethel's face. "What are you talking about?"

"I can't remember why I came in here." the young bard's voice faltered. He began to pat himself about as if looking for something concealed within his garments. "Ooh that sparrow is singing such a lovely song." Then when his hand alighted upon the neck of his lute, He smoothly pulled it into the grasp of both hands and began to strum its strings. Then his rich high tenor began to confidently weave lyrics into a song.

		Threads of thought, return to me,
		Whispered shadows set me free,  
		Echoes of what was, now I see.

Over and over, again Aethel chanted these lines as he improvised a melody and plucked a matching harmony with the lute. While he was parked in the middle of the room, Korralan stood there watching him, for this was behavior which was completely new to the former Soulcrusher from the House of Bravone. "What is he doing?" His interrogation ambushed Lyra and Vanya as they rejoined in the library.

Lyra stopped by the door and just looked at her brother. Studying him like a spell within one of her mother's books before she said, "He is frightened of something. It seems like he thinks that something has stolen a part of his memory and he is trying to restore himself."

Meanwhile, Vanya had been rustling through the shelves lining the room where she found a roll of parchment tied to a bound journal. Taking them over to the table upon which Aethel was seated, she spread them out and began to study them. Lyra could not hide her curiosity and alternated between reading over Vanya's shoulder and glancing at her brother. Korralan's concern mollified, began to search the about the room. In a corner, located on a shelf by itself he found a dagger made of copper. "Oh look, someone was kind enough to engrave this one in Dwarfish."

"Well what does it say?" Vanya distractedly asked.

"From the Veilded Den's outer chamber's - dare not venture deeper".

"Really? It says that?" Lyra asked.

"I did read it correctly." Korralan walked to the center of the room to show the dagger. As he got closer, he noticed that the sheet of parchment on top of the pile was a map. 

"That pretty much solves the puzzle." Lyra started to explain. But was interrupted by Korralan pointing at another piece of parchment scattered on the table.

"That one is in dwarfish too," He seemed surprised, perhaps not by the language of the letters, rather by what they spelled out. "It mentions The Crimson Codex."

		Threads of thought, return to me,
		Whispered shadows set me free,  
		Echoes of what was, now I see.

And the rats came swarming back into the room in even greater numbers than before. Korralan once again began battering them, as Lyra and Vanya gathered their found materials off of the table and began to leave the room.
