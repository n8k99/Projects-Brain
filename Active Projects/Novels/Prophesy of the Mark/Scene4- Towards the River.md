title: Scene4- Towards the River
---
The icy road west out of Hatfield was cut deep into the glacier, a pale trough of packed snow and old axe work. Ox dung steamed on its surface in scattered heaps, each dark mound a fresh reminder that the caravan had indeed labored up these switchbacks only hours before. The tracks of many wheels scored the ice, already beginning to glaze over as the afternoon chill settled in.

Korrallan’s boots crunched as he passed the last of the town’s sheds and crude shrines. The square and the Mine Bell were behind him now. Ahead, the first of the road’s cutbacks rose, a white wall cutting his view of anything beyond the immediate turn. The sky felt too big. Even with the glacier face rearing up on either side and the mountains hemming the valley, there was still an expanse above him where there should have been stone. His shoulders kept wanting to hunch as if expecting rockfall.

“If you do not want to add distance,” Lyra said, breaking the long silence, “there is a footpath down here.”

Korrallan slowed. The elf had paused at a break in the roadside berm, a narrow chute carved into the ice where snow had been trodden to a faint stair. Wind had piled drifts against it, but under the powder he could see old pick marks in the glacier wall.

“It’s quite a bit steeper than the road,” Lyra went on, “but faster. It drops straight to the valley floor. The road takes a long curve.”

“How do you know about this?” Aethel demanded. His tone came out sharper than perhaps he meant it to, an edge of wounded pride under the question. “I grew up here and never heard of some secret path.”

Lyra rolled her eyes. “How do you think Mother and I get down to the taiga to gather lichen for our kits and back in time to finish dinner?” she shot back. “The road is for wagons.”

Korrallan stopped fully. The wind clawed at his beard; the cold scraped his lungs. He studied the path for a moment, then nodded once and moved to follow her without comment. A steeper, more direct route felt right. He had not chosen the Ember Trial to spend extra days plodding down a road carved for commerce.

The footpath proved exactly as advertised. Within a few steps the incline tipped from “steep” to “you will fall if you do not pay attention.” Lyra led with an ease born of repetition, feet finding the half‑buried edges of old cuts, hands occasionally brushing the ice wall for balance. Korrallan’s heavier boots slid more than hers; the leather creaked as he shifted his weight carefully, testing each placement before trusting it. Vanya took up a position just behind him, using the dwarf’s solid silhouette as a partial windbreak, eyes scanning ahead and below.

Aethel grumbled at first, muttering about frozen toes and undignified scrambling, but his long elven legs soon found a rhythm, and he fell silent, breath puffing in controlled bursts as he focused on not tumbling into the others.

They descended in a zigzag, each short traverse ending in a tight corner where the path cut back under itself. The glacier rose above them in pale, striated walls, the occasional embedded stone jutting like dark teeth. Somewhere beneath all of that ice and rock, the mines of Zhulmar reached out in geometric veins, carrying heat and metal and old grudges. Up here, though, the Dominion’s will expressed itself in more fragile ways: in the road, in Hatfield’s precarious buildings, in the Mine Bell that had just re‑asserted its authority.

Lyra reached the last drop and hopped down the final lip, snow crunching under her boots as she landed on firmer, darker earth. “Watch your step,” she called up. “The last bit is a little jump.”

Korrallan eased down after her, gripping a rough spur of ice with one hand before letting himself fall the final span. His boots hit loam instead of frozen runoff, and the sensation almost unsteadied him more than the descent had. Earth. Not stone tunnel floor or glacier, but actual soil, damp and springy with the memory of roots.

The change in the air hit him next. The cutting wind from the glacier wall softened here, filtered by a fringe of trees. The sharp tang of rock frost gave way to scents he had rarely encountered this directly: pine resin, wet bark, the faint, sour musk of something small and furred that had passed recently. The taiga spread ahead in a rough tapestry of scrub and stunted evergreens, bare branches rattling quietly against one another.

Brief stands of brush dotted the valley floor, their branches crusted with frost. Rocks lay half‑buried in rich brown loam, their surfaces stippled with moss and lichen in greys and greens Seldiesal would have catalogued with a healer’s eye. Birds flickered between trees at the edge of sight, their calls blending into a thin, constant chatter. Larger insects skittered away at the vibrations of four sets of footfalls, vanishing under leaf litter and fallen twigs.

They walked for a while in near silence, the crunch of their boots and the rustling undergrowth the only sounds. The valley ran roughly east–west here, channeled between two lines of low hills. Farther ahead, it would bend toward the Rarhoci River and the stone arch of the Infernal Route bridge. For now, their path wound through sparse tree cover and the gentle undulations of the land where glacial melt had once carved temporary streams.

“What do you know of the Roadmarker of Sundering?” Korrallan asked, when the ground leveled enough that he did not have to watch every step.

He directed the question toward Vanya without looking back. His tone was not unfriendly, but it carried a weight that suggested he cared about the answer in more than an idle way.

Vanya had been half expecting the question since he first said the name in Hatfield. She had seen the way his shoulders had straightened at the mention, how his jaw had clenched when Seldiesal’s prophecy had folded the Sundering Stone into his fate. She had been deliberately keeping quiet, letting the dwarf and the twins set the pace of conversation. Now that the door was open, words she had been holding back for two seasons pushed forward.

“It is one of the more interesting specimens of monumental architecture I have seen in the last two years,” she said.

Aethel snorted softly at the phrase, but Korrallan only made a low sound that might have been assent or effort as he stepped over a fallen branch.

“It looks like an obelisk,” Vanya continued, “but on a different scale. It is as if someone took the common boundary stones you see at crossroads and borders—those black or grey pillars with carved faces—and then grew one of them until it could cut the sky. It is embedded in the glacier there. The ice has flowed around its base like water around a buried spearhead. From a distance, it looks like it is simply rising out of the ice, but once you get close, you can see the way the ice has yielded to it, not the other way around.”

Lyra’s head turned slightly as she listened. Korrallan grunted again and, this time, the noise carried a current of wary interest.

“You have been on the road for two years?” Lyra asked. “Where did you start?”

“I joined the caravan as it was leaving Myranth,” Vanya said. “I had spent some time in the city’s lower archives, then in a couple of private collections. The caravan needed someone who could read four dialects and spot forged manifest seals at a glance. I needed to follow a trail of references that kept pointing west along the Infernal Route.”

Lyra’s eyes brightened. “Myranth,” she breathed. “I have always wanted to go there. To study in the libraries, the real libraries, not just Hatfield’s ledgers and hymnals. I want to learn magic properly someday.”

“Do not let the ‘real’ part fool you,” Vanya said, stepping over a rock Lyra had vaulted easily. “Most of the towers in Myranth house bureaucrats, not sages. They build shelves to impress each other, not because they like the smell of old paper. But there are pockets.” She let herself remember the cramped reading rooms, the chained volumes. “I went to several of the libraries. I did not get to sit and read in many of them. Not the way I would have liked. Time is coin, and caravans move.”

“And monumental architecture?” Aethel asked, seizing on the phrase that had stuck in his ear. He hopped up onto the same rock his sister had cleared, balanced for a beat with the easy grace he always pretended was effortless, then twisted to step down facing backward, so he could speak while walking. “I have heard those words before, but never together in a way that made sense.”

Vanya smiled to herself. The bard’s curiosity, while wrapped in theatrics, was genuine. “All over Orbis,” she said, “there are standing monuments—towers, obelisks, carved stones—that share certain features. The Thirteen Towers are the most obvious example, of course, but there are lesser cousins everywhere. They are usually tall, narrow, aligned carefully with cardinal directions or with something stranger, and they carry carved runes or pictograms that do not match the local script.”

She thought of the pages she had copied from a Myranthian treatise on “Pre‑Imperial Structural Anomalies,” of the author’s dry speculation that such monuments might all be descended from some single, pre‑Cull system of markers. The Thirteen Towers of Orbis gaming tomes described them as remnants of the old colony network, devices that had once tracked worldtracks and atmospheric flux. Vanya did not know how much of that was metaphor and how much was literal. She only knew that when she stood near such things, the air felt different.

“They are all obelisk‑shaped?” Lyra prompted softly.

Korrallan had spoken the word under his breath a moment before, and Vanya nodded. “That is right,” she said. “The proportions vary, but the pattern holds. Always taller than they are wide, usually with four faces, sometimes more. As if they were designed to be seen from a distance and from every direction at once.”

“They are not all made of the same stuff,” she went on. “That is important. The one near Dhodh‑La is carved from green‑veined stone that rings like glass when you tap it. Some of the ones in the Emerald Vales are so weathered their edges have rounded away, as if the stone itself has been slowly melting for centuries. I have heard of monuments in the eastern deserts made of metal—true metal, not stone pretending—though I have not seen those yet. The Roadmarker of Sundering is different again.”

“How?” Aethel asked. The need to know the shape of the story tugged at him as surely as hunger.

Vanya let the question hang for a few strides, partly to sort her thoughts, partly because anticipation had value. The land underfoot began to roll more, the loam giving way to stretches of exposed gravel where old meltwater had rushed. Shadows lengthened as the sun dipped behind the Emberspine peaks to the west, washing the valley in a slow greying.

“It appears to be a single block,” she said at last. “No seams. No sign it was built in stages. Just one enormous piece of black stone, smoother than it has any right to be, standing in the ice like a shard of night. The standard markings—the old border runes, the declarations of Zhulmar’s jurisdiction and the Etrivalian tribes’ autonomy—are cut about halfway up, where you would expect them. But the base is… crowded.”

“Crowded?” Lyra echoed.

“Covered,” Vanya corrected herself. “From the glacier line down, every handspan of reachable stone has been carved. Names, sigils, little pictographs. Some are fresh and sharp; others are worn half away, like old scars. There is a rubble ring at its foot from all the chips and flakes. When you walk up to the Roadmarker, you are not walking on pure ice anymore. You are walking on a path of fallen stone fragments, like a garden path someone made from the monument’s own skin.”

“You touched it?” Korrallan asked. There was something taut in his voice now, a note she recognized from scholars in Myranth who had just realized a favored text contained a clue to their own lives.

“Of course,” Vanya said. Her tone was deliberately bland, not flippant. “Putting hands on old things helps. Stone remembers pressure differently than paper does words. You can feel which marks were carved with reverence, which in anger, which in drunken bravado. The Roadmarker has seen a great many of all three.”

“That sounds like a fascinating way to study,” Lyra said, as if her mind had leaped immediately to the method rather than the impropriety.

“When I am learning a new spell,” she went on, “I have to practice the hand motions over and over until they feel right. My fingers remember before my head does. Maybe it is the same.”

“That is the silliest thing I have ever heard,” Aethel snorted. “Equating poking a rock with the Art.”

“I have heard you practice the same passage on the lute until even the rats in the rafters know the tune,” Lyra shot back. “You know exactly what I am talking about.”

“That is not the same as putting your hands on a stone,” he said loftily. “Besides, how many spells have you even learned? Mother has not taught you much yet.”

“Rocks can tell you things,” Korrallan said, cutting across the budding argument. His voice was flat, factual. “If you know how to listen, they tell you where the weight has shifted, where pressure runs, where something does not fit and must eventually break.”

Neither twin found a retort to that. The path narrowed briefly, forcing them to walk single‑file. Branches clawed at cloaks and hair. The sky dimmed another shade.

“Indeed they can,” Vanya said after a moment. “And the Roadmarker… speaks more than most. As you approach, there is a hum. You do not hear it at first. You feel it in your ribs, as if some deep machine were turning slowly in the world beneath your feet. Put your ear against the stone, and it drowns everything else. Someone could shout in your other ear and you would feel their breath but not their words.”

Lyra looked back over her shoulder. “You did that?”

“Yes,” Vanya said. The memory was still sharp: the shock of the cold stone against her skin, the way the hum had grown until it filled her head, the sense that something vast and patient had turned its attention toward her for a fraction of a heartbeat and then dismissed her as irrelevant. “One of the caravan guards was the one doing the shouting. By the time he dragged me away, they had nearly decided to leave without me.”

“That hum,” Korrallan said slowly, “does it feel like… the Towers?”

Vanya’s eyes flickered to him. He had not named which Towers—the Thirteen that anchored Orbis’ strange weather and metaphysics, the lesser watch‑towers scattered through the Dominion—but she knew what he meant. “Similar,” she said. “But not as strong. The Towers bend worldtracks. The Roadmarker marks a crossing of them. Or so the Myranth treatise suggested.”

She did not add the rest aloud: that some scholars believed the Sundering Stone, specifically, had been keyed to the war that had birthed the War of Ash and Iron. That its surface had once displayed more than names—that it might have tracked which side held what ground in real time, back when Forge Kings and dragon‑backed emperors played games with whole valleys.

They walked on. The land rolled them gently downward toward where the Rarhoci’s sound would soon replace the white hush of snow with water’s constant murmur. Above the low hills to the south, Vanya could just make out a smudge of darker forest that marked Nocigez, the spiritual heart of the Etrivalian tribes they would someday have to win. For now, those threads lay dormant.

“So why,” she asked casually, ducking under a branch, “did you leave the mines, Korralan? You seem to have been in a position of some comfort there.”

He did not answer immediately. His boots logged another dozen steps over uneven ground. When he spoke, his words were as tight and compressed as ore in a sealed vein.

“I was tired of crushing other people’s souls,” he said.

Aethel seized on the phrase. “Crushing souls?” he said. “What does that even mean? Smashing their dreams? Their joy? Killing their pets?”

“If that is what you think it means,” Korrallan muttered.

His tone made it clear that was all they were getting for now. Whatever the Ember Trial had been for him, it was not a story he was ready to offer to a pair of surface elves and a human he had met that afternoon. The outline in Vanya’s notes about the Trial—about Durnek Bravone under pressure from the deep courts, about a son turned into a political fuse—remained lines on paper for the moment, not confession.

“Is anyone else hungry?” Lyra asked, looking back again.

The question cut the tension like a warm knife. Vanya laughed, the sound bubbling up more easily than she expected.

“Of course we are hungry,” she said. “We walked off a glacier into this mess, the sun is setting, and this is exactly when our stomachs expect stew.”

They found a notch between two low, rocky rises where scrub trees offered a little shelter from the wind. The ground there was less boggy, more gravel than loam, with enough fallen branches to feed a small fire. Korrallan helped gather stones to ring it, more out of long habit of building safe hearths underground than any fear of the sparse taiga catching alight. Beside him, Vanya sorted through the collected fuel with an expert eye, setting aside damp pieces that would smoke but not burn.

Lyra surprised them by producing a small, battered cooking pot from her pack and an assortment of wrapped parcels. “Mother always keeps something ready,” she said when Vanya raised an eyebrow. “Herb mix, dried root, a bit of smoked meat. We cannot always rely on Hatfield’s tavern stew, you know.”

Soon, the thin blue curl of smoke turned thicker and white as the fire caught properly. The pot steamed as Lyra stirred its contents with concentration, muttering what sounded suspiciously like spell mnemonics under her breath as she got the timing right.

By the time the light had faded to full dusk, the stew had settled into a rich, savory scent that made Korrallan’s stomach knot in a way that had nothing to do with unease. They ate in relative quiet, the simple act of sharing food smoothing some of the earlier friction. Aethel, predictably, made appreciative noises entirely too loud for the quality of the fare, but Lyra glowed at the praise all the same.

When bowls were scraped clean and rinsed with a little melted snow, Vanya stretched, feeling the day’s miles in her calves. “I have been on my feet since dawn,” she said. “If no one objects, I would like to take first rest.”

Aethel gave a theatrical sigh. “You do realize,” he said, “that my sister and I are elves, yes?”

“Of course,” Vanya replied. “I simply did not want to assume you would be content to sit in trance while I drool on a bedroll.”

“As my brother is trying to say,” Lyra chimed in, “we do not sleep. Not exactly. We will meditate. Our minds will drift, but our ears will still work. So go ahead and take proper sleep. We will keep an eye on the fire.”

Korrallan got to his feet without comment and lumbered off a short distance into the dark, seeking the familiar comfort of stone overhead. He found a large boulder jutting from the hillside, its underside carved out by some ancient erosion into a shallow overhang. It was not a tunnel ceiling, not even close, but it shielded a patch of ground from wind and snow. He crawled in under it, the rock’s cold mass above him a small balm.

Despite the day’s exhaustion, his mind refused to still. Images flickered in the dark behind his eyelids: the hierarchy chamber of House Bravone with its ring of red‑veined columns; his father’s face tight with a mixture of anger and something like fear; the Ruby Circle envoys’ smooth, inscrutable expressions. The Ember Trial petition had felt like a chisel blow at the time, sharp and irrevocable. Now, lying on dirt beneath open sky, it seemed more like the first strike of a much longer cut.

Only yesterday he had slept in a private alcove carved off one of Haas Bravone’s main tunnels, surrounded by the familiar density of worked stone, lulled by the distant thrum of forges and the murmured movement of other dwarves. He had responsibilities then—teams to coordinate, quotas to manage, ore flow to track. Not power, exactly, but authority. Respect. He had not been his father’s favored heir, but he had been a Bravone, and that had meant something.

He had thrown it away. Or perhaps, he thought, rolling onto one shoulder, he had simply knocked loose a stone that was already cracked. Stories about the Ember Trial always ended cleanly—hero dies, hero succeeds. They never talked about the middle, about the sudden absence of the pressure that had been shaping your entire life, or about the strange vulnerability of walking under weather.

Now he lay on ground instead of carved bedrock, trusting three strangers—one human tied to a faction he only half understood, two surface‑born elves who had never seen the deep—far more than he trusted most of the dwarves he had left behind. The realization should have been terrifying. Instead, warmth from the stew and from the fire’s distant glow seeped into his frame, and for the first time since the Mine Bell rang, he felt something like honest fatigue.

Last time he had laid down to rest, he had been turning the Ember Trial decision over and over, tracing every ridge of risk and consequence. He had not reached an answer before sleep took him then. But when he woke and dressed for the hierarchy meeting, he had known. The fear of not knowing what came next had been less than the dread of continuing as he was.

Out here, under a sky pricked with clearer stars than any he had ever glimpsed through mine vents, the unknown felt… if not welcoming, at least clean. His thoughts slowed. He watched his breath fog in the shadowed space, counted ten more inhalations, and slid into sleep.

Back at the fire, the twins sat back‑to‑back, knees drawn up, eyes half‑lidded. The flame’s light painted their faces in warm golds and sharp shadows. The sounds of the valley at night pressed in: the distant rush of the Rarhoci, the occasional creak of tree trunks adjusting to cooling air, some small creature’s brief panic in the underbrush.

“Aethel,” Lyra whispered.

He made a noncommittal noise.

“Was this the best idea you have ever had?”

He shifted slightly, as if adjusting a cloak. “Are you afraid?” he hissed back.

“Of course I am,” she said. “We are out in the open. We have no proper supplies beyond what Mother could throw in a pack in a panic. I have no idea whether we even have half of what we need to survive between here and the Roadmarker. Do not tell me you have a plan you are secretly following. It is obvious you jumped when the story got good.”

He chewed on that. Lyra could almost feel the shape of his thoughts against her back.

“You are right,” he admitted, eventually. “It was hasty. But what would you have had us do? Stay? Work the same winter and summer patterns until we shriveled? Or worse, go back now? Climb up the glacier and walk into the square with our tails between our legs? We would be the laughingstock of Hatfield until the end of the age.”

Lyra snorted. “It is an option,” she said. “One that will keep us alive.”

“It is not an option I want,” Aethel said. “Now, if you do not mind, I am trying to rest. Dread tomorrow if you must. Tomorrow will arrive either way.”

They fell quiet. Their bodies relaxed by degrees, breaths slowing into the rhythm of elven trance. Thoughts drifted into the half‑dreams where old songs and new anxieties braided together.

Vanya stayed awake, spine propped against a low rock, cloak wrapped tight. She watched the fire’s heart and the shadows it cast; she listened to the valley breathe. When her hands grew restless, she pulled out her notebook—a sturdy volume crammed with surface‑scrawled script, diagrams, and the occasional crude map.

By the fire’s flicker, she flipped to the section marked with a scrap of woven green cloth: High Nook Valley. The pages there were dense. Place‑names jostled with distances, all underlined with notes from Myranthian texts. Akalaya. Dhodh‑La. Infernal Route – segment HN‑3, local name “The Teeth.” Den of Ghesh‑Balor – pre‑War of Ash and Iron fortress, later bandit hold. Her own marginalia crawled through the gaps: “possible Consortium dig near eastern shoulder?” “Old Settlers’ proverb about ‘stone that sings of cutting’ – Roadmarker?”

The Thirteen Towers of Orbis system texts had framed High Nook as a liminal zone. The portal network did not touch it directly; the nearest stable gate was in Dhodh‑La, a world away in caravan terms. Dragons circled its politics but rarely landed. That left space for other forces to move: the Consortium of Whispers, small cults, local powers like the Emberborn and their Ember Trials.

Somewhere in this valley, if her reading was right, lay a thread that connected an old piece of tower‑era technology—some “Northern Repository” of the Archive of Whispers—to the Crimson Codex in the Ruined Chambers of the Vampire Knight farther north. The Master Chronicle’s dry entries about the War of Ash and Iron hinted that Ignarath the Scorched Tyrant had made plans in these hills that never made it into official histories. If those plans had been recorded anywhere, they would not be in nice indexed volumes in Myranth. They would be out here, in stone and forgotten strongholds.

The caravan had been a compromise: slow enough that she could dart off the road now and then to examine a ruin, safe enough that she did not die learning the shape of every ambush chain the hard way. But there were limits. Rimthalien had tolerated a scholar in his ranks because she could save him from bad contracts and spot when a “bandit” leader was actually a disgraced noble trying to launder his reputation. He had not been interested in spending weeks exploring every side canyon that tugged at her instincts.

Now, with the caravan gone on and coin from the last week’s wages heavy in her purse, she was free to follow those instincts. Free, and tied to an Ember‑Tried Bravone whose goals happened, inconveniently and intriguingly, to line up with one of the key landmarks in her notes.

She glanced toward the shadow where Korrallan slept. The Bravone name had not been in any of the surface‑level texts she had found in Myranth; its significance had emerged only when she dug into Dominion‑approved histories and found, in the gaps, hints of how House Bravone had once brokered deals between Forge Kings and dragons. The Ember Trial that had exiled him could be a simple act of personal defiance. It could also be a move in a deeper game—one the Consortium would be very interested in if they had not orchestrated it themselves.

Vanya did not work for the Consortium. Not officially. Not in any way that would stand up in a tribunal. She had heard rumors of their operatives in the valley, diggers with too‑clean hands and too‑keen eyes hunting for scraps of ancient technology. She had no interest in letting them get there first. The Master Chronicle made it clear enough what happened when single factions cornered power meant to be shared.

She turned a page. A penciled sketch of the Roadmarker stared back at her—crude, more shape than detail, but enough to anchor her memory. In the margin she had written, in a moment of uncharacteristic sentiment: “Standing on ice. Feels like it shouldn’t be there. Feels like it was always meant to be there.”

She tapped the page thoughtfully. The soothsayer’s words in Hatfield still rode the back of her thoughts: a deeper mark than you expect. Prophecies were imprecise tools at best. But if Korrallan did carve something into that stone, and if what she suspected about the monument’s old functions was true, then his chisel might do more than scratch his name. It might tug at the worldtracks themselves.

For now, though, there was stew in her stomach, notes under her hands, and a fire between her and the dark. The Rarhoci’s distant mutter promised fresh water ahead. Somewhere beyond that, in the folds of High Nook’s hills, kobolds and their unseen patron were already arranging logs and kill‑zones along the Infernal Route.

Vanya checked the fire, fed it another branch, and went back to reading her cramped Myranthian citations by the glow. It was likely the most alive she had felt since the caravan had left Dhodh‑La and the last sight of the Emperor’s storm banners had dipped below the horizon.
