# 1
Excitement danced through the air, jumping from one resident to the next. A caravan was seen approaching up the winding glacial path to Hatfield and everyone in town knew that it would be arriving in the middle of the village by the time the bright star above was at its daily perihelion. Midday was always the best time for a caravan to pull into Hatfield. All the morning chores would be finished, the miners emerged from the copper vein for a mid-shift meal, and people could begin to exchange goods and services with the traders. Refilling vital supplies which could not be accessed in any other manner for an afternoon would be more important than gathering peat for evening fires in their homes. There might even be a feast which happens tomorrow. The size of this caravan added extra juice to this village's nerves. There were people watching the switchbacks and they could not see an end to the procession of wagons.  

Children who were at their mothers strings, danced on nerves already frazzled by the pressures of running a home within the harsh conditions atop the glacier. If their husbands had not been paid handsomely for risking their lives for the shiny orange ore they pulled from the ground, there is no way that this village would exist. All the dwarves in town lived the same life, dig deep in the mine, pull out the copper and pray to the Ember Spirits that the Flamewardens preached about that they would come back up at the end of their shift. Hatfield was not the end of the planet but it sure felt like it sometimes when the caravans traveling the Infernal Route did not come in to trade. Some mothers, some few of them, pinched their gold pieces and managed to send their children off to the few tutors in town, the hope that they would learn to read letters and write figures so that they could escape this path. 

Seldiesal Sol-astra had her healer's kit tuck under her arm as she hurried across the large square at the east edge of town. Nervously glancing at the large building which housed the Local Watch as she headed off from visiting a sick miner who was not able to report to work today. She received a little bit of coin from the town funds to do this as there was a pressure to keep as many miners as possible digging every shift. The town itself was run by other dwarves from deeper in the mine. This entire town was set up mostly for the sake of having a place to set up a market for the raw ore. So having a miner or two not show up because they had too much to drink the night before, or the cold weather made it through the thin walls of their home, or for whatever reason, was normal and the town had her go and check up on them. Today, the dwarf was actually quite ill, and barely was able to sit up when she had checked on him and administered the healing herbs. She even used a bit of a magic to help ease his suffering. Turning to the Watch Office, she walked in to collect her fees.

"Brinyar had the culp" she announced as she entered the front office.  Riminion Helcral was sitting behind his desk, scratching on a piece of parchment with a quill. The Squad Leader didn't even look up at her as she breezed into the room.

"Make sure you shut that door tightly," his voice gruff and harsh while he absently reached into a drawer of the high desk. She could hear his finger clinking coins as he absently dropped them on to the edge, just missing her outstretched hand. He made a few more marks on the page.

"I had to cast." She added with a bit more steel in her voice than she ever felt when asking for her fair rates to be honored. He looked up at her then, raised his eyebrows and grunted. His hand reached back into the drawer and this time the motion was smooth and silent before a larger, more yellow coin was dropped on her pile of silvery white coins. She caught this one before it hit the desk. "I may even have to return to see him in the morrow, it was not good."

"If it comes to that, then we'll be sending Brother Loody." the battered old soldier's voice sawed through the air, "Based off his remarks at Temple lately." And then abruptly stopped, leaving his sentence unfinished as if he were only allowed a finite number of syllables. 

"I am sure you know best." She did not feel quite like participating in this pitting her healing against the clerical services of Ralilion Loody. After all, despite being human and having deeply delusional beliefs in the power of the Ember Spirits, Brother Loody genuinely cared about the people in Hatfield. These dwarves from the deep mines who had been sent to the surface, well standing where she was, was not the place to put those thoughts into the air. 

"Oh if it isn't my favorite Elf!" Durni Trueblood had a habit of popping out of his office in the middle of transactions like this, "I do believe you were saying that it was the culp, that usually passes quite quickly, especially after you have worked your magic, hmm."

"Aye it does with the young ones, but Brinyar has been going down into the vein for decades and his lungs are not what they used to be." She countered the Overseer's argument as gracefully as she could.

"Oh but we dwarves are a hardy lot who can dig for a century or more" His freshly oiled beard hid his mouth as effectively as if he had none, while his eyes laughed merrily, silently. "I am certain that old Mr. Ironsleeves will be swinging his pick as hardily as ever tomorrow." His fingers pushed the draw on the desk closed as a full stop to his sentence. Then he smiled at her, showing his teeth. "That is if he doesn't have too much to drink tonight at the White Warrior Inn, you know as the traders will all be sorted with their rooms for the night and wanting to have a little merriment in the tavern and all that."

Her face tightened and she clasped her lips as thinly as she could. Restraining her first two or three comments that sprang to mind. "Aye, I will likely be very busy in the morning, so I should head to the house to get myself ready for a rest." Finishing putting the coins in her purse, she headed back outside.

"Make sure you close that door properly" Riminion barked at her as she was slamming it firmly.  

Outside in the crisp air, she could see that the first wagons were pulling into the western end of the village. Hatfield was so small, standing in the main square, the western end of town where the winding road entered the huddle of huts and houses was a straight shot where the top of the glacier had been leveled out decades ago. As she walked towards the gathering townspeople who were welcoming the traders to the village, she picked up the excited hubbub of the group. Everyone was running low on the necessities and the nice things had been out of everyone's pantries for weeks. Even Baoscott's Trade Post was down to just the weapons and sacks of basic products. What little fruits and produce had been in the village was gone. So it was right that everyone was excited, especially given that this caravan was so long and large. Especially given that it had come from the north where the Zhulmar Dominion borders the steppes controlled by the Coalition of Etrivalian Tribes and the Infernal Route originates a thousand miles away in Dhodh-La.

The first cart stopped right at the place where the road in reaches the Main Square. Its driver swinging down to tend to the oxen team pulling the load. Seldiesal had to navigate around it as a swarm of children and townsfolk gathered around the wagon. When she got to the rear of the boxy cabin on wheels, a door swung open and a bombastic man appeared on the porch-like platform.

"Hallo Everybody! Did you miss us?" His greeting full of amusement and merriment, as a light of joy seemed to illuminate his face from the inside out. Seldiesal noticed her daughter,  Lyra, standing back from the crowd , watching, observing, cataloging all the interactions in her mind. Seldiesal noticed that Lyra was refraining her instincts to pull out her little book and start taking notes, but her hand was hovering over the satchel where it was keep. She joined her daughter in watching the festivities of the arriving wagons. As each one came to halt, the crowd would move along and greet them. Some of the residents would return to what were quickly becoming favorite carts, such as the first one with the jolly barker who by now had produced a lute and and was playing a very excited tune. 

"Well that does it," Lyra began muttering, " Aethel is definitely going to want to leave with this group." Then she began to chuckle. Seldiesal stole a quick glance at her and could see that the emotions on her face were engaging relief, and thinking to herself that the younger twin carries too much of the world on her shoulders. 

"If they'll have his pomposity." she said, "That one there might find Aethel too much competition to have along for a months long journey." Lyra looked at her mothers face, and then both women shared a laugh at the truth of the matter.

"Oh look, it is our fearless Overseer" Lyra pointed at the Watch House with her chin, and out the front door which had been left wide open, Durni had started trotting across the square. His legs, short like the rest of him, his beard a thick shield in front of his body, immovable due to all the oil he was constantly massaging into it, even his dwarvish arms were comically double timing the patter of his feet. He had just reached the first wagon when the jolly man on the back of it swung down into the crowd. 

"We almost did not come up here!" He announced in a booming voice, Seldiesal thought that he obviously had had some bardic training the way it was projected in such a polished manner, "That gang of kobolds just past the river crossing harassed us all the way to the turn off. A smaller and less protected caravan would not risk the slow climb to your lovely little hamlet." The crowd gasped and expressed dismay at the thought of traders skipping them.  Durni had slowed to a walk and was jostling his way through the crowd. 

"Kobolds?" As he stood in front of what was so obviously the leader of the caravan and the words he had just heard were sinking into his brain, "by the river crossing? But we have patrols" His trailed off into silence. 

The silence was cast across everybody for in that instance the Mine Bell began to clang out an urgent tone. This was not the mine bell which Hatfield and its residents, its miners who dug out the copper of the higher levels of the mine would use as a signal. This was the Mine Bell which had no obvious pull rope that would tell anyone from where it was being rung. This was the Mine Bell which was put into place years ago when the troop of Deep Dwarves emerged from the lowest levels of the mines and began to thrust their control over the small village. This large iron bell was located in the very center of the Main Square and no one who had lived in Hatfield for any amount of time could recall it ever begin rung.

The toiling was insistent, penetrating all aspects of the tiny burg. The responses amongst the Hatfield people was ubiqitious; all who heard it, and that was everyone, froze in place. The only ones who seemed to be immune to its spell were the traders, Durni and those in the watch house. Shouting could be heard clearly across the square, in time to the bell.

"Up and at it you lazy good for nothings!"

"Dress Armor! Don it Now!"

"You pathetic little twits fall out and muster in the square!' 

Clearly Sgt. Helcral was in his element. This is the exact sort of moment his entire career of being a solider was about, hurrying his raw recruits into the square to respond to whatever emergency that was about to unfold. Durni Trueblood's face had lost all color. He turned and slowly began to cross the Main Square once again, ignoring the barker who was in explaining in mid-sentence how many kobolds were attacking them and for how many days and nights they suffered the ambushes.

"Hey! I'm telling you that if you don't fix this, your tiny little isolated town is going to fall off the map!" Durni had just walked away from the the negotiation he was not even aware that he had been. The bell rang and rang and rang. His steps mechanically showed what and where his actual fears were located. Riminion Helcral had managed to get two parallel lines of watch to form a gauntlet outside the Mine Entrance. The miners from Hatfield always entered the mine from a small side entrance that did not have a door, it was just the maw in the side of the mountain directly into the shaft. But there were massive wooden doors which apparently lead to another shaft altogether, and this is where the troops had formed up. Just as Overseer Trueblood stepped into the end of the formation, between the two lines of soldiers, that set of doors began to creak open.

The Mine Bell rang its final note and it was as if the spell had lifted. The townsfolk, subdued began to slowly shift from the newly arrived caravan whose carts where still creaking up the winding road to the village and clogging the main road of town. Traders would swing open their doors, expecting crowds of eager buyers and befuddled by the way everyone was silently shuffling along to the Main Square. Seldiesal spied her husband and their son, Aethel, both clutching their instruments in their hands exiting the Tavern. They had been getting ready to entertain the noon meal. She grabbed Lyra's hand and began to cut across the flow of townsfolk to the Main Square to join them. Her husband wrapped his arm across her slim elvish shoulders. His height towered above her. They had both come to Hatfield to escape the tragedy of oppressive forces. The gold dragon they had worked with, learned so much from, and felt like they were friends with, cut down twenty-five years ago. A shocking event that was unpredictable in their minds, despite Seldiesal's skills in divination. They had built a quiet and comfortable life here in the Riellis mountains, and yet this moment had the emotional tension of all that about to come crashing down yet again.

The two elves and their children seemed to be the only townsfolks who were not charmed in someway by the giant bell's toiling. All the surface dwarves were drawn to the center of the village by what only seemed to be magic or perhaps it was just part of the culture that they did not fully comprehend and for the first time in twenty-five years, they felt like outsiders. The traders from the caravan were also immune to whatever was happening, but curiously they followed along behind the milling dwarves as they pressed into the Main Square and formed a cordon behind the clustered villagers.

The massive doors to the Mine Entrance slowly, majestically creaked open, revealing a massive black hole into the side of the mountain, upon which rested the icy glacier which formed the foundation for Hatfield. Resonating from someplace deep within, the heavy clump of boots marching in time, a horn sounded and came blaring out of the mine, cutting through the trance of the crowd and a murmur spread as everyone began to nervously glance about, checking to see that their neighbors were just as alarmed and worried as they were.

Deep in the shadows of the mine shaft, a squad of heavily armed troops slowly became more visible as they marched towards the open doors. Right up to the threshold and then they halted. There were barked orders and a pair of guards escorted a third dwarf whose hands were bound together in front of him. The captive dwarf was dressed in a higher quality of leather, his cloak thrown back over his shoulders. Even though she had lived amongst dwarves of Hatfield for a quarter of a century, Seldiesal still found it difficult to determine individual features of one dwarf from another until she had been around them for significant time. However this one, while not handsome nor charismatic, she could tell was somehow different. He was still bearded, all dwarves have beards. He was still short and stocky, but this one seemed somehow wilder, more ferocious, untamed. The two guards beside him produced a key and unlocked the irons on his wrists. The troop Captain standing to the side bellowed out, "Above the foundations laid out by Forge King Meganum Drulmor , By decree of the Ruby Circle, from demand of the Ember Trial, by request of Durnek Bravone, Forgemaster of Haas Bravone, ye all witness the expulsion of this former Soulcrusher, who has willed himself to find his name upon the surface of this planet we call Orbis"

The two guards then shoved the former prisoner into the pale sunlight and stepped back into the ranks of the troop. Durni Trueblood, seemingly realized that somehow this was his cue, sang out in a cracking unsteady voice. "We, um, do accept the responsibility entrusted, um,expected in possession of this prisoner. Sargent collect him." He then stared at Riminion Helcral, who was taking a deep bellow in order to power his bellowing at his own soldiers.

The Captain of the Mine Troops, then cleared his throat, " I am afraid that you have been on the surface too long to recall that the Ember Trial is a voluntary separation from the Zhulmar Dominion. This dwarf is no more a prisoner than you."

His face turned a violent shade of red as Durni sputtered out his response, "Ah thank you for reminding me of this nuance. Of course, it is so rarely requested, and who can believe all the myths" His voice trailed off as he could see that his perspective was not being met with the same attitude that he was accustomed. "But I am glad to do our part here."

The Captain, who was on the verge of bristling during all of Durni's speech, relaxed a bit at this moment, "There is nothing you need to do, the trial is not for you." And in this moment, Korralan Bravone who had been rubbing his wrists, turned to the Captain and extended his hand. The Captain aware of this movement, slightly abashed that he forgot his duties due to the surface thoughts of an ignorant dwarf, reached with his left hand to his belt and pulled a broad and shiny axe out of it holder. He placed the handle in Korralan's outstretched hand, who weighted the weapon carefully and then slide it into place upon his back. The young dwarf turned around and face the gathered twonspeople of Hatsfield, cleared his throat before gently posing a question to the entire assembly.

"Which way to the Roadmarker of Sundering?" A gasp, a shock, a surprise, a susserration of responses as the entire collective seemed to search for the same information all at once. And then just at the same moment, there were patches of people pointing in various directions all at once. Korralan looked about, made some internal calculations and nodded. He walked through the gauntlet of watch members and when he got to Durni Trueblood who was blocking his progress, he briefly glared at the Overseer who then abashedly steppd out of the way. As Korralan moved past him, Durni then realized that he had lost whatever control he had had of the situation and then once again began to sputter out words.

"The Roadmarker? What do you want that for? It is too far, you will never make it, we have a place here for you." Not realizing that he was spinning further and further out of influence over events, Durni was metaphorically falling in line swiftly behind everything. "In fact, if you prove to be a good digger, in a couple of seasons, you could be advanced to head up a team."

The young dwarf who had stepped out of the deep mines stopped abruptly. He paused for a moment, and the entire audience of the burg of Hatsfield held their collective breathe. They sensed that what he was about to say was going to be significant, important and biting, and he did not let them down. He did not turn around and face Overseer Trueblood, which seemed to give his words even more bite as they cut through the pretentious dwarf. "I am walking away from a position I was born into that you will never reach through all your preening and posturing, do you really think that I am going to allow myself to be subjected to whatever it is you are offering me?"

Then he kept walking. The crowd slowly parted as he passed and then closed in behind him. Durni then was hit with what he thought was inspiration, "Who can show this dwarf where the kobold are ranging? Perhaps he would like to know that"
An unfazed Korralan kept walking through the silent crowd who just shuffled out of his way as they stared in awe as he passed.

A voice rang out from the back, coming from within the gaggle of traders gathered behind the townsfolk, "I'll be glad to show him." A wave of people moving out of the way opened a path between the origin of the voice and Korralan and he made the slight course correction change his bearing. The opening of the crowd, revealed a female human with a smirking expression on her face. Seldiesal was intrigued as she inspected this unlikely volunteer to venture out into the harsh biome, but her thoughts were interrupted but a pair of voices singing out in quick succession right next to her. Knowing those voices intimately as she had birthed them both on the same night minutes apart, her heart dropped as first Aethel, "I'll go with him" and then quickly Lyra, "Aye, me too." seconded him. And just like that both her children had committed themselves to an adventure which neither one knew what lay at the end of that road. 

Then they both moved into the space between the dwarf and the dark hair lady. Korralan looked at them both and continued plodding along, and they fell in behind him, both of them nervously looking about as if they were questioning the rightness of a decision which seemed to be made in haste. Seldiesal's husband sprang into motion, rushing off to their home nearby. As Korralan reached the end of the volunteer's space in the crowd, Rielan returned from their home with two packs and rushed through the gap in the crowd, pressing them into the hands of both of their children. This act seemed to calm and steady them, as if it were the permission that they needed to stick with such an impulsive action. Seldiesal's heart was simultaneously breaking and dancing for joy and she felt big heavy teardrops welling up in the corner of her eyes.

# 3
Overseer Durni Trueblood was seething and aghast. He was racking his brain as he stood there, watching the big Mine Entrance doors close behind the receding troops from deep down. He knew, he just knew that there would be some report that that Captain was going to file that would come back and bite him. How could he possibly know that dwarves from the mines would voluntarily leave the embrace of the Zhulmar Dominion. The whole ancient society which the dwarves had been building underneath this portion of Orbis for probably thousands of years. How was he supposed to know that the Ember Trial was a real thing, he had only ever heard of it in stories about heroes. The kind of stories that were read to young dwarfs when it was their bedtime. Stories that were meant to give them pride in their upbringing, teaching the nature of their culture, and to serve as warnings to not follow their leaders. All the stories he could recollect about the Ember Trial were about dwarfs who either perished out on the surface by themselves, or had some massive stroke of unbelievable luck to find something that the dwarfs needed to make their society stronger. Who had the audacity to think that their society needed to change now!

Once the massive doors had finally closed, Durni turned around and began to elbow his way through the crowd of townsfolk who had closed behind the stranger's path. This added more fuel to the roaring anger within his heart. Dwarfs who until this morning would not dare to get in his way anywhere he went in this pithy little village, insignificant folk who were just stepping stones to him, and now they were transfixed and enchanted by this supposed heroic figure who had somehow usurped the entire power dynamics of Hatfield with a grand entrance. Racking his brains as he clawed his way to where the 'prisoner' set free in his town was standing. There was that meddling cleric, Brother Ralilion Loody standing in the open circle of townsfolk and caravan traders. He appeared to be talking to the leader of the caravan. Nearby were those elf twins from Hatfield, Durni had never really liked them much, especially as he was dependent upon their mother's healing to keep miners working every day. And some human lady dressed in green leathers was standing confidently within the gather circle. Durni finished elbowing his way into their midst.

"So what is going on here?" He demanded while barely concealing his ire. Calmly, the priest from the local Flamewatchers temple turned and looked at him.

"Ah, Overseer Trueblood. Caravan Master Aloevan was just expressing his gratitude that this fine young dwarf had volunteered to take care of the gang of kobolds who have been harassing traders and travelers on the Infernal Route. Which I am sure that you and the Local Watch will greatly appreciate as it will spare you to fulfill your more important duties here within Hatfield."

"I think that would be something that the local watch and the Overseer would be keen to take care of as this village would cease to exist very shortly if smaller and less protected caravans did not risk the slow climb up the side of this glacier." the caravan master was smug and his human face did not take any measures to avoid his emotions. "Although I am going to greatly miss the very informed presence of Mistress Sol in our train, I know that she has been practically clamoring for an excuse to cut out for a couple of seasons to go snooping around in some old ruins." The woman in green leathers smiled in a manner which appeared to suggest that she'd rather laugh at this but had considered the moment inappropriate for such a display.

For some reason this really began to irk Durni, and he was about to really lay into everyone in the circle but as he was trying to decide who to let it out on first, Aethel Sol-astra had to open his pompous elf mouth.

"I have been itching to see the Roadmarker of Sundering for quite sometime, it is supposedly a magnificent monument that has stood for eons" the young bard could not restrain himself from displaying how little he thought of the dwarfs of Hatfield. The poor miners who didn't know any better might think his act was hilarious but he would was a member of the Ironhaven Clan knew that the elf lad was not pretending to be disdainful.

"And what is your reason for being here?" Durni shook his finger in the face of Lyra, Aethel's twin sister, "What do you think you will be able to do?"

"I would watch my tone with my daughter, Overseer Trueblood." the twins mother stepped into the circle, pressing a satchel into her daughter's hands. "They are both more than capable of taking care of themselves and if they have decided now is the time for them to set out on a little adventure then they have my blessings."

Fuming at the way this was turning into complete farce, Durni opened and shut his mouth a couple of times before he managed to get anything to come out. "That's just wonderful, now we will be down to only two healers in Hatfield, who will watch after the miners while she is gone?"

Brother Loody chuckled as he began speaking, "Perhaps if you were more concerned with the miners well being, you would give them a day of rest once in a while instead of flogging them into breaking rocks for your own interests both night and day. But I am just one of those healers who must keep repairing them as they break down, so what do I know?"

The strange dwarf who had emerged from the mine, seemingly having heard enough of the idle talk turned his gaze away from the Overseer and face the human woman in the green leathers, "You say you know where the Roadmarker of Sundering stands?"

"Of course I do, we passed it after travelling through the steppes. It is the first monument on the Infernal Route where the dwarfs have control. Then a couple weeks later we passed the Cliff of Sorrows before crossing the river. Which is exactly when the bandits began to ambush us."

"And if we had not be better armed, they might have done some serious damage to our chances to continue on to Akalaya" the Caravan master chimed in. "Again, I have to suggest that the local watch should have done something about this earlier."

"I had no idea." Durni began to interject into the conversation defensively.

"What I am sure Overseer Trueblood will agree is that these bandits you are reporting have been quite elusive and any of the patrols that he had sent out were avoided by them." Brother Loody's voice was attempting to calm the waters by sprinkling sugar across the surface and this only grated further on Durni's ears. 

"So you know the way?" Korralan cut through the noisy political bickering which was happening around him. When Vanya Sol nodded in the affirmative, he added. "Then let's go." And he began to head west towards the obvious exit to the town. All at once, like gravity had connected them, the circle broke apart while the three volunteers stepped into his wake, leaving Durni standing there alone. For Caravan master Aloevan and Brother Loody both moved in a different direction which seemed to be a heading to the Temple of the Comet. Only Seldiesal Sol-astra remained and even she did not face the overseer as her husband joined her. 

Instead her eyes unfocused on the scene around her, a glaze came over her face and her voice took on an eerie starkness, "You will leave a deeper mark on the Sundering Stone than you have imagined." Who she cast these words to was not obvious, however the young dwarf from the mines, paused mid-stride and then immediately began to move once again. Then she and her husband moved in yet another direction, towards the tavern. No doubt to go be quaff pints with the traders and villagers who had all gone back about their business as the day's free entertainment was obviously over and done with. 

Alone in the rapidly dispersing crowd, Durni began to sulk as he trudged back to the Watch House.

The icy road leading westward out of Hatfield was cut deep into the glacier. There were periodic piles of steaming ox dung that served as indicators that the caravan had indeed lumbered its way up the steep cutbacks. As Korralan was clearing the first cutback out of the village, Lyra piped up, "If you don't want to add more distance, there is a footpath that leads down here. Its quite a bit steeper but also faster than the road."

"How do you know of this?" Aethel was but doubtful and dumbfounded that he was not aware of this little secret, so his tone was cutting and dismissive.

"How do you think Mother and I go and gather lichen for our herbal kits from the valley and get back in time to finish dinner?" The shorter more slender twin shot back with equal temper. Korralan just stopped and waited to follow her down the trail. It was indeed quite a bit steeper than the road had been, and required a great deal of concentration from all of them as they clung to the slick glacier face, but within half an hour, they managed to reach the valley floor where the taiga took over as the dominate theme of the landscape.

Brief instances of scrub brush and rocks covered with moss and lichen were strewn about the rich brown loam underfoot. There were spots of birds in the near distance, and the scurrying of large insects as they felt the vibrations of footfalls from the four humanoids crossing the terrain.

"What do you know of the Roadmarker of Sundering?" Korralan posed his question to Vanya, when they were on a relatively flatter patch of land and it appeared that they need not have so much focus for movement. 

"It is one of the more interesting specimens of monumental architecture that I have seen in the past two years." She unfurled her response in such a way that it was obvious that she had been aching for a long time to unload this information. "It seems to be embedded in a glacier and appears to be constructed from a single piece of the largest black stone I have ever seen."

Korralan just grunted but that could have just been the effort of clearing a particularly large rock which lay in the path of the trail. Lyra had cleared the same obstacle quite easily as her elf legs were much longer. She was intrigued by something that had caught her ear, "You've been on the road for two years, where did you come from?"

"I joined the caravan as it was leaving Myranth."  Vanya dryly responded, "and have seen several different examples of monument architecture."

"Oh Myranth! I have always wanted to there and study in their famous libraries so I could learn real magic." Lyra could hardly contain herself as the secret desires came out of her. "Did you ever go to any of them?"

"Of course, but I did not get to  sit and read in any of them" the human also had very little trouble clearing the rock in the trail. Meanwhile Aethel, practically danced upon it and then gracefully twisted himself fully about as he stepped off. As his foot lighted upon the trail he blurted, "What do you mean 'monumental architecture?' I have heard those words before but never together."

Vanya smiled to herself, "There are numerous monuments dotted all across the Orbis, they all look quite similar, I would say identical but each one is ever so slightly different. They all have strange markings on them midway up as if giant stone cutters stood on each others shoulders to carve the runes into the face of the monument."

"They are all obelisk shaped." Korralan added. 

"That's right," Vanya agreed. "But they are all made of whatever is in the land nearby, so some places the monument is really hard stone and the edges are as sharp as a blade and others the stone is soft and eroded to the point of almost being round. I have not seen them but there are supposedly places where the monuments are made of metal."  They all continued on in silence for several minutes as the land got more challenging. The sun was also starting to slide behind the large mountains towering over them to the west, so the light was beginning to fade into the grey of dusk.

Unable to contain himself any longer, the need for a resolution to the story burning his instincts, Aethel blurted out "So the Sundering Stone is unique in all that you have see somehow?" 

Resisting an urge to snicker at his curious method of asking, Vanya once again smiled to herself, "Aside from it seeming to be one large block of stone, and the typical carvings midway up it, the base where it is engulf by a glacier is covered in many different carvings. These are so obviously made later as there is a pile of rubble at the base so thick that when you are walking on the glacier to touch the monument it is like being on a footpath in a garden."

"You touched it?" Korralan seemed to be somewhat offended by this notion. 

"Of course, I love to place my hands on ancient ruins to get a sense of their place in the world and in history." Her tone was bland enough to signify that she meant no harm by her actions and pitched in just such a way as that it was clear that she did not think that there was a real cause for an argument.

"That sounds like a fascinating way to study things," Lyra chimed in, as if she were naturally predisposed to soothing out any ripples of conflict, "I know that when I am learning a new spell, I have to spend time just practicing my hand motions so that I can get them right when I need it."

Aethel scoffed at this, "That is the silliest thing I ever heard!" 

Lyra, "I have heard you practice the same passage over and over and over again on the lute, so you know exactly what I am talking about."

"But that is not the same thing as putting your hands on a rock!" He retorted, "Besides how many spells have you had to learn, Mother hasn't taught you that much yet has she?"

"Rocks can tell you things if you can listen" Korralan laid this out flat as if he dared either of the elves to argue with him. This stopped their bickering for a minute, which was long enough for Vanya to continue her story.

"Indeed they can, and the Roadmarker seemed to be able to speak in a manner which you could hear. As you got closer to it, there was a deep hum which if you put your ear on it got so loud that someone standing next to you, shouting in your other ear could not be hear."

"You did that?" Lyra was more than a little curious about this. 

"Yes, I did that. And if you must know, it was one of the guards from the caravan screaming that I had to hurry up or they were going to leave me there. Apparently, I had been leaning against it for a long time." Vanya plodded on through the brush that was overhanging the trail right behind Korralan who had merely stooped a little to get beneath the thorny branches. "So, call me intrigued, but why exactly did you leave the mines?"

"I was tired of crushing other people's souls." the dwarf clamped down his answer in a tone that it was more than clear that that was all the explanation that anyone was going to get out of him, and yet Aethel tried.

"Crushing people's souls? You mean like their dreams? Their joy? Their hopes? Murdering their pets?"

"If that is what you think it means." The taciturn dwarf muttered.

"Is anyone else hungry?" Lyra turned her head back to look at everyone following her. This question seemed to break Vanya's resolve and she laughed quite heartily at it. 

"Of course we are all hungry, we have just walked off a glacier into this barren land, the sun is setting and it is the time of day our stomachs are used to being filled with something warm and soft."

After they had built a fire and Lyra made a surprisingly good stew, Vanya said, "I have been travelling on my feet since dawn, I hope no one minds if I take first rest." To which Aethel responded, "Well, you do realize that my sister and I are elves, right?"

"Of course I did, I just did not want to be rude and assume that you'd mind."

"As my brother was trying to say, we do not sleep, we can't sleep, so we will be meditating for our rest." Lyra chirped in cheerfully, "So go ahead and get your sleep."

Korralan got to his feet and lumbered off into the dark away from the fire. He found a large boulder nearby which had a suitable overhang and crawled up beneath it. Despite having been awake for well over a day, his mind was racing as it recollected all the events which had rushed by. It was just a day ago that he was in a position of relative privilege, overseeing the productivity of some rather important mines in the Zhulmar Dominion. He was perhaps not his father's favorite son but he was well loved and respected, given authority and power within the family's business. And he had thrown it all away by demanding the Ember Trial. From that moment forward, it was a rush. A sequence of irreversible events as he was systematically and categorically removed from the grand society of the dwarfs which lived underneath the Emberspine Peaks. Last night he had slept in his own private quarters in fairly well appointed luxury, at least for a dwarf. And now, now he was huddled beneath a rock, on the ground, and was putting some of his trust in three strangers, three races which he had never actually seen with his own eyes until he stepped out of the mine into the sunlight on top of the glacier at the mine head. 

Last time he laid down to sleep, he had been turning over the decision to request the Ember Trial. He had not come to his decision before his eyes had faded shut. However when he rose and dressed for the Hierarchy Meeting in Haas Bravone, he knew what he was going to do. He was not afraid of the consequences, nor did not knowing what the future held for him frighten him. In fact, he was still somewhat excited and amazed that he had gone through with it and was out here under stars in the sky. And with that thought, his eyes closed.

It was a grey dim light that shrouded the landscape of High Nook Valley. The rocks and scrubby bushes that served exclamations of irregularity and nature's hand in its formation, were all dark shapes breaking the uniformity into smaller areas of sameness. There was one bird who awoke to the rising sun and began to sing, and within moments a cacophony filled the air across the entire taiga. In that instance both Lyra and Aethel who were seated back to back with their legs crossed beneath themselves, opened their eyes and the meditative and passive watch they had been keeping through the night was at an abrupt end. 

Aethel as ever in his character, leapt to his feet and picked up his lute. Plucking each string, testing it for tune, until he was satisfied and then his fingers began to limber themselves up across the frets of the instrument's neck. It was not a song or tune that one who sits in the audience of a performance would ever hear, it was the waking of the music within through an exercise which stretched out each of the muscles of his hands, loosening and and increasing their flexibility so that later more musical challenges could be readily met with a high degree of success. 

Lyra slowly unfolded herself from the posture that she had adopted in the night, bent forward from the waist and touched her toes with her hands. She breathed in the chill morning air and exhaled her warm breathe onto her legs. Once this movement was complete, she followed a pattern of stretching movements so that her body was fully engaged with the act of rising from the deep restful state of the night. Her movements were subconsciously following the same patterns of stretching and limbering that her brother's fingers were engaged in. Finally when the two twins had full restore themselves to complete alerted wakefulness, they set about to stir the fire back into life in order to prepare some hot tea and warm food to break the fast.

Seated within the scraggled limbs of one of the ever present rush bushes, her dark green leather tunic and robe blending in to the plant nearly invisibly, Vanya remarked, "That is quite the waking ritual." Her voice made Lyra start, nearly dropping the small kettle of water into the the infant fire that Aethel was blowing life into. "It must be nice to not sleep." Vanya added.

"Oh my! You startled me!" Lyra exclaimed, 

"My Apologies was not my intention." The human had a dry and academic manner of speech about her, as if she were more accustomed to dealing with communications as a burden than a pleasure.

The fire leapt to a blaze from Aethel's efforts, "I don;t know why we do it this way when you could just wave your hands about and make a roaring fire." He prodded at his sister.

"Basic it is a necessary skill to have and relying on magic for basic things is lazy." Lyra's response to her brother was automatic, as if they had had the exact exchange hundreds of times. She then turned back towards Vanya, "I would not knew any other way for it is how my entire life has been lived. Not that I have lived very long."

"fair enough, I guess my observation is based on my own experiences which include a requirement to sleep." Putting a stopper in her ink bottle and wiping off the nib of her quill, Vanya tucked away the little book which she had been marking down observations and then stood up. She turned to face the mountain to the east behind which the sun was struggling to rise. "Do you think those clouds will clear out soon or will we have rain today?"

"Father calls that Dragon's Breathe" the older twin sat back on his haunches and stared at the fire where the kettle was beginning to boil, "He says that every morning this time of year the glacier lets off clouds as it wakes up. The Dwarfs in the village love that story. By midday the sun will burn through it." From then the trio sat in silence as they drank tea and ate the rest of the stew from the night before. The cleaning up and stowing of gear in their packs also was conducted in silence. Vanya carefully observed the two elves, watching their faces as if she were examining a cryptic message carved into the walls of a ruin. "You are suddenly questioning the wisdom of your decisions?"

Lyra nodded and gestured about, "We have very little supplies or equipment and off we just headed into the wild open. I do wonder how we will manage this." Aethel seemed rather thoughtless about this turn of conversation and idly reached out for his instrument, once again plucking at its strings. Vanya reassured the young elf, "We will survive just fine. There is plenty to gather and eat along the way. Travelling in a caravan is certainly not the lap of luxury."

Just in that moment, Korralan stepped into the circle. "We need to move." Without waiting for any responses, he turned and faced away from the slowly rising sun and began to walk. The remainder of the party scurried about, shouldering their gear, kicking dirt over the remnants of the fire, and hurried after him. For a couple of hours they walked in this manner, Korralan alone fifty feet or more in front of the trio who followed behind. Aethel had slung his lute across his back when it became obvious that they were not going to stroll along, yet still he lagged in the rear, while the other two scrambled and traded positions often. This marching order lasted until Korralan halted at the bridge where the Infernal Route crossed over the Rarhoci River, 

"The Infernal Route" Vanya said as she stopped next to him and indicated the direction it followed to the north, "that's the direction of the Roadmarker." Pointing the other way, "That takes us back to where we came from." He grunted in acknowledgement and then began to trod across the bridge north. The twins caught up in that instance and the four of them went over basically together. "I was here just a couple of days ago" Vanya added as they stepped off the bridge, waving her hand to her left, "Over there is where the kobolds came from, that was their last attack on the caravan."

"Where there many of them?" Lyra quizzed but before she could get a response, a loud crash came from the right side of the road. Everyone turned to look at the cause and spied a large group of small reptilians charging at them. They had knocked over an old tree trunk that had been propped on a rock, and several of them tripped over it as it rolled towards the group on the road. In an instance, the four adventurers turned to the west and began to run away from the pack of greyish-green kobolds. Korrallan's axe had leapt into his hand. Vanya had a dagger in each hand as she ran, while both Lyra and Aethel were the furthest in the lead away from the swarm of attackers.

The log rolled completely across the road and came to a halt on the opposite bank of soil. Uphill the party ran, fortunate to have been alert enough to avoid the initial ambush. The kobolds screaming behind them hurled stones and spears which chunked into the ground beside them as they ran onwards. Whenever one of the small but fierce villains got close enough that it could swing a club at Korralan, the dwarf would turn and face it and attempt to cleave it in two with his battle axe. More times than not, this resulted in a very blood and heavily damaged bandit who had to give up the chase. But due to their sheer numbers, for more kobolds were joining the chase by the moment, streaming from hiding spots all around the bridge, the four adventurers had to keep running up hill. At one point, Lyra stopped, settled herself and then waved her hand in a well rehearsed up sweeping pattern then boldly exclaimed, "Pilinnar!" as she hurled her hand towards the pursuing bandits. Three missiles appeared and leapt towards targets, striking the three closest kobolds and giving them a painful reason to reconsider the pursuit. At least for the moment.

# 6
Having gained a temporary reprieve by inflicting damage to the nearest pursuers, Lyra turned and sprinted uphill, very nearly catching her brother, with Vanya and Korralan trailing close behind her. Dodging through the thickening grove of trees on the side of the mountain, there seemed to be a trail leading upwards. She nearly ran over Aethel when she entered a small clearing next to a cliff face. He was standing there staring upwards, the rock soared and twisted into an enormous buttress of sorts for the upward slopes of the mountain. Knowing that all her life she had seen this mountain from her burg and had never once considered that she would one day be on the side of its slopes passed through her mind for a brief instance. 

"There, that is where we go." Korralan brusquely ordered, pointed at the base of the cliff where a crevice had been enlarged by stonecutting instruments. Lyra felt her face flush as she realized that she had been caught up in the grand scale of the cliff and its lack of safe routes to escape the noisy kobolds that were still charging up the side of the mountain towards them. They were hooting and hollering, and this gave her the sense that they had slowed down a bit.

Vanya followed Korralan's point axe and rushed into the gap in the base of the wall. The rest followed her example. Within the crevice, the the space around them opened up into a squared out courtyard of sorts that curved at towards the north where a massive entrance way had been carved into the rock. The stone was shaped by exquisite craftsmanship into the appearance of an enormous dragon's head. It mouth was opened into a wide sneer and its tongue had been carved as an elaborate set of stairs which flowed up into the foyer, which seems like an awfully weak word to describe such an imposing and elaborate architectural moment, which was essentially stepping into the mouth of this gigantic stone dragon. As they walked up the tongue stairs, Lyra noticed that there were two large teeth carved out of stone with massive keyholes insert in their tips. These keyholes were large enough that she thought she'd be able to fit her head through one of the openings if she really felt brave enough, but the copper stains which flowed down each tooth from the bottom of the holes gave her a really uneasy feeling. 

In the back to the throat was large set of copper colored doors. On the corner walls to either side were smaller single wooden doors. Massive draconic runes over the frame of the cooper doors gave the entire entrance a very foreboding feeling, even more so as her mother had taught to read the runes, "Here dwells the Iron-Fisted, whose copper tears flow eternal." she announced to the rest of the group. 

Aethel turned from the copper door and looked at her, "What did you say?"

"That's what it says over the door" She pointed at the runes. 

"That's just downright creepy." He retorted, "I mean that you can read what ever those letters are, but also what you say they say." Extraordinarily, Vanya seemed to no longer concerned about the approaching bandits, in fact she had her little book out and was marking it up with whatever she was finding. Pointing with her quill, "These doors are made of iron but they have an ancient treatment which coats them to look like copper."

"I am familiar with this technique, we sometimes use it in the mines for decorative armor, it is very difficult to do properly and these are masterpieces" the dwarf sounded as if he was in admiration as he examined the obstacles in front of him. "They will be impossible to open without a key."

Putting his hand on the doors and then snatching it back just as rapidly, "Why are they so cold?" and then tipping his head at a curious angle, he pulls his lute into his hands and begins to search for a particular note when he seemed to have found what he was looking for, "and why are they humming this note?" his continued ostinato serving as an amplified illustration of his point. 

"There are scratches here in common which say 'Beware the Iron Fist'. And over here it says, 'The Peaks remember'. What are The Peaks and what do they remember?"

"Oh. Maybe that's the Kingdom of Three Peaks" Aethel brightened up, "There's a pretty lively song that the villagers always seemed to throw more copper at me. It had a very catchy refrain that says, 'Fear the Storm Reapers for their swords cast lightning. BOOM BOOM. We Drink to the Three Peaks, BOOM BOOM, We Drink to the Three Peaks, BOOM BOO, We Drink to the Three Peaks, may we never see them again!'." Having broken into a rousing perform as he progressed, but not getting the audience participation that he was accustomed to, he ground the song down to a halt, returning to his ostinato of the door's hum, "It's basically a drinking song about heroes who die to save the Three Peaks."

"The Three Peaks was a surface kingdom that was wiped out by the Shadowfell six hundred years ago," Korralan matter-of-factly stated. "Which lead to the rise of Ignarath the Scrotched Tyrant."

"Oh that is another great epic!" Aethel beamed  and began to pluck the opening figure of another song, "It starts off with this…"

"Now is definitely not the time or place for that Aethel." Lyra sternly admonished him. "They are not talking about The Dragon's Balls are Fire, no matter how much you like to sing that song."

"That song, I know about," Vanya looked up from her book. Then as if remembering why they were standing where they were, "Do you think we should find a way inside to get away from, you know?" Pointing back towards the woods where the sound of the kobolds was getting closer.

Korralan was standing by one of the wooden doors to the side. He took a moment to appraise it and then with a quick succession of hefty blows with his axe, the door was separated from its hinges and fell away from him, into the underground structure.

Aethel quipped, "well if anyone complains, we can definitely say that we knocked."  Then as the others stepped into the stronghold, he began to strum his lute and lightly sing to himself, "goodness gracious, hmm, hmm, hmm, goodness gracious…"

Lyra popped her head back out the door frame, "Are you coming or what?". Aethel then let the lute slide back around behind his back and headed towards the door. The moment before he crossed the threshold, he paused long enough to draw his rapier, tested its heft and then strode as confidently as anyone ever into the darkness looming before him.

"Oh Sister, I am here to be your protector!" Aethel sing songed his voice as he entered the stronghold proper. A flick or two of his wrist made his rapier sing as well. Glancing about, then losing the expectant look on his face as he took in the atmosphere and decorations of the long chamber he found himself in. Obviously the room itself had been carved into the mountain by very extremely skilled stone cutters. The hall had obviously been used to display an impressive display of trophies and weapons and where many other vain rulers with expansive collections would have just pointed out a room in which to build cabinets and stands to host his precious items, the original inhabitant of this place pointed at a slab of mountain and told his stone cutters to build a room specifically for the job.  Cabinets and display cases were cut into the stone, carving out the place where swords, maces, spears, antiquated armor, shields all stood in an astonishing display of wealth and power. Nearly every item had some sort of copper accent, which lead Aethel to believe that whoever gave them to the collector that the piece was created with his own very well-known aesthetic philosophy in mind. It was mind boggling all the different pieces in one place: dwarf axes, human swords, elvish blades, and these strangely beautiful and terrifying curved weapons from no land or cultures that Aethel had ever known existed.  

Everything had a layer of dust on it, but it all seemed perfectly preserved, except for a case in the middle of the floor which had been destroyed, and one of the line curved swords which must have been kept in it was partially buried in the pile of rubble on the floor. Aethel put his rapier back in its belt hook. squatted down at the pile of rubble, shifted a few large stones and freed the blade on the floor. "Well Overseer Trueblood will be having nightmares of rebellions and sending the watch out to inspect houses at all hours of the night if he finds out about such a well stocked armory just a day away." he pulled the blade partially out of the intricately designed sheath on which red dragons seemed to dance up and down it, and naturally from this collection there was inlaid copper highlights intricately incorporated into the design. Carefully laying his thumb on the edge of the weapon and then putting it in his mouth directly, "oh that is sharp!" Aethel exclaimed.

"Would you hurry up!" Lyra hissed at him from much further down the hall where the rest were at. Sucking his thumb the whole way to the far end of the hall, Vanya had her book out still and was taking copious notes while Korralan was wiping off his axe. At his feet were the dead bodies of three kobolds, they had been hacked into a bloody pile and there was a growing puddle of blood surrounding them. 

"So you're telling me that those dwarf axes predate the War of Ash and Iron?" Vanya had a look that she was in the midst of attending the most fascinating lecture she'd ever been in. And she was seemingly oblivious to the ichor flowing under her boots. 

"That's right, and while very few of these weapons were made by dwarfs, they are of the work of the highest crafts makers who had obviously studied with dwarf masters." Finishing wiping down his axe, he pointed at a cabinet behind them, "that case in particular"

Vayna quickly glanced up from her book to notice where he was pointing, "the one with the elf blades?"

"Exactly, but if you knew what I know, you could see how the traditional elf forging tcchniques were not used to craft these very traditional blades. Its plain in the way the edge is set on them, dwarf sharpening was used, which does not work on and traditionally tempered elf blade."

"Are you okay?" Lyra whispered to him. 

"What?" Aethel didn't take his thumb out of his mouth and then realized why she was asking him he removed it and looked at it, "oh this? This blade is very sharp." He held the long katana up as proof for her to see. "You don't think anyone will mind if I carry this around for a little while?"

"These kobolds have been using weapons from this armory, so you are probably fine to, um, borrow it for an indefinite period of time." Vanya smiled at him as she paused her note taking to answer him. Then with her quill she pointed at a point behind Aethel's head, "That banner up there, what period do you suppose it is from?"

Korralan lifted his had and stared at the broken banner hung above the large display case full of human plate armor and shields with various different heraldic devices painted or engraved into their surface. Some of which had both the fancy smith work and the brilliant enamel colors designating the origins of their owner. "That's your Kingdom of Three Peaks. A human kingdom that once controlled the surface. I think they are a couple centuries before we fought Ignarath."

Aethel followed her pointing as well, only he walked all the way over to the display and looked closely a tarnished silver chalice on a shelf. Next to it was a cracked stone tablet, waving Lyra over he pointed it out to her, and then drifted back towards Vanya and Korralan. 

"So pre-War of Ash and Iron?" the green clad human had once again bowed her head over her little book and was furiously writing down everything. Her brow wrinkled with the concentration, and her rapid movements between the ink bottle and page seemed to Aethel to be dangerously close to causing a massive splatter in any moment. 

"Yes. That's the right time" the dwarf nodded even as he affirmed her question. 

"Is this place all from that time period?" Again the pen scratched on the page and this time it echoed slightly in the hall as everything seemed to stand still for just a moment, and then Korralan began to walk about and examine the weapons a little more closely before he answered. "No this is, do we call it newer, that feels wrong because it is also older than the war." 

"So I sing a song about a kingdom that has been gone for centuries and it makes dwarfs happy?" Aethel took his thumb out of his mouth just to express how incredulous he was at this comment. "That is just preposterous!"

Korralan shot a dark look at the elfish bard and leveled his voice, "Dwarfs have long memories, never forget that boy." Then turning to Vayna he began to walk towards a passage that lead deeper into the mountain. "We need to keep moving, we are going to have visitors very soon and this is not where I want to face them."

"What I want to know is" Aethel began to mutter to himself, "what sort of training does it take to be a Soulcrusher and how does he know all this stuff?"

"Maybe if you ask him he'll tell you." Lyra lightly chided him as she passed.

"Oh yea like he'll answer me. I'm pretty sure he doesn't like me one bit." The elfish bard let himself slip into another sulk. "I bet if she asks, he'll tell her."

"Well she does seem pretty smart." Lyra chortled.

"I'd stop at pretty." her brother despondently whimpered. 

"Are you saying that he only talks to her because of how she looks, like some sort of barbarian!?!" Lyra mocked her surprise, "no wonder he doesn't like you!" And with that little stab, she flounced off after the other two party members once again leaving Aethel behind. He just turned around and faced the Hall of Broken Blades like it was an old friend who he might never see again and then backed hius way into the passageway.

---

# 8
Korralan stormed into the passageway full of determination leaving Vanya and Lyra to scurry along behind him. When the dark tunnel turned to the right, he somewhat recklessly marched onwards. Then passed a large door to the left but ignored it.

"Hey! Aren't you going to check in here?" Vanya had stopped at the door and began to examine it, because the hallway they were in now no longer had a light source, she had to take a moment to light her bullseye lantern. 

"No I am not going to explore every little room we come across. We have a real situation on own hands here." The dwarf whipped around to face the taller human, shaking his axe at her menacingly. Lyra hide behind Vanya's body and peered around to look at Korralan. "We have been chased into a dead end by a gang of kobolds who do not seem like they want to be friends with us, and until we solve this problem we are not safe to have your little ruins reading class."

Vanya settled her face and then deliberately put her book away. Taking care to insure that the ink bottle was properly stoppered. She then drew her rapier into her right hand. "You are correct. There is a more immediate problem, but I have a solution."

"That is good to hear," Korralan gruffly retorted. "Let us hear your solution." 

Just in that moment, Aethel caught up with the party in the passageway. "Hey there you are, look I think most of the bandits are in this place, they will catch us if we don't get out of here." Looked at him and gestured for him to keep quiet. "Oh, ok, so they are going to find us if we are not careful" He murmured much more quietly.

"These kobolds, like most of their kind, rarely ever form a group as large as this one without a leader imposing fear upon them." the green clad human began to unfurl her latest cognition results, "so we find the leader and make a big spectacular end to him in front of them and they will all flee in fear, which will give us enough time to get out of here before they realize that the numbers don't add up."

Korralan paused for a moment to consider this suggestion, "It seems like it could work, I guess this all depends on finding the leader soon, or else we are going to be slaughtered."

Aethel interjected, "I can hear them coming through that pretty armory, so we need to move soon." And with that Korralan turned and began to run deeper into the hallway, leaving everyone behind to realize that they needed to move with him. 

Vayna's lantern bounced as she sprinted after the dwarf. The twins, both were light on their feet yet they still made a slap pattern as their boots struck the stone floor beneath them. Suddenly the passage opened up into a large chamber. There was a fire roaring on the floor and five kobolds were lounging about eating and drinking. A shout from back in the room alerted the resting bandits, who then sprang to their feet and began to free their weapons. In an instance, Korralan was upon them, slashing and hacking with his axe. His first blow carried all the momentum of his running and laid out the bandit completely. Putting his foot on the kobold's thin lizard-like chest to put his blade out of its torso, left his back exposed to another bandit's effort. However, Aethel managed to deflect that attack by swinging his new sword like a club into the attacker's waist. Immediately realizing that the sword was still sheathed, he quickly freed the blade so that the steel shone brightly in the fire light. 

Another kobold approached Korralan from his left, swung its sword at him but because he could see the blow coming, the dwarf managed to dodge the blade as his axe came free from his first victim. Lyra stepped between Korrallan and her brother hefting her quarterstaff with both hand and brought it crashing down on a fourth advancing foe's head. Her strength was not sufficient to knock him out but it did cause the grey green creature to pause momentarily before it made further advancement. The last kobold began to slink around its comrades looking for an angle to attack the trio clustered next to the fire. It was shouting and yelling for others to find them quickly, and there was an immediate roared response from the passageway. The sounds of scurrying foes rushing headlong into the room, screaming and cursing was deafenening.

His axe finding a new home in the bandit's skull who came at him from the left, Korralan grunted with the effort and roared. While Aethel's blade now free from its sheath, found itself embedded in the hips of the foe in front of him. Lyra's opponent shook its head an stepped towards her, and before it could thrust its sword at her, she waved her right hand in a smooth gesture, then latched onto the kobold's sword arm while uttering "Panya íta!" Lightning flew from her fingertips and surged through the bandit's chain mail. The shocking grasp jolted the creature severely and it fell away from her, dropping its sword and hit its head on the ground rendering it unconscious. She turned to face the way they had come, where the rushing mass of the ambush force was entering the circle of firelight. 

A roar from deeper in the room, caused the party to turn their heads at once. The kobolds all froze in their tracks as an orc stepped into the circle of firelight. At his throat was a dagger in the hands of Vanya Sol, whose eyes danced about the room taking inventory of the situation. "Now it seems I have everybody's attention." She loudly proclaimed, and then ruthlessly sliced the orc's throat cutting through the veins in its neck. Its hands grasping the wound as he sunk down to his knees and Vanya's dagger bit into his back in multiple successive strikes causing him to topple face forward onto the stone floor. His blood seeping out in a torrent. This caused immediate pandemonium within the gang as they stampeded over themselves in fear. 

Korralan briefly gave chase, cutting down several more gang members but their fear drove them all to move so much faster than he could keep up, so he returned to the chamber. Vanya had just finished cleaning off her blade and slide it back into its hiding spot, "Do you think our problem has been solved?" She calmed asked.

"Aye," the dwarf responded, "for now."

"in that case, I have some work to get done here" She handed her bullseye lantern to Lyra to hold, and pulled out her book and quill. "There seems to be a key made of silver in the center of this dais. Shine that light over here." Lyra held the lantern up higher and illuminated the raised floor which seemed to dominate the center of the chamber.

Aethel was searching around the fire for where he had tossed the scabbard for his new sword, "What do you mean, you have some work to do? Shouldn't we be getting out of here before they come back?"

"Oh Darling," Vanya's voice was icy, "Those lizard brains will run in fear for a whole day before half of them realize that there were more of them than us. And then it will take them another day to get everyone else to see it, then they will fight for another day before they manage to get someone to lead them back here. And even then, most of them will peel away in the night and find someplace easier to prey."

"If that is the case why did the caravan leader made such a big deal of them to Overseer Trueblood?" The bard had found the sheath and was working out how to get the blade back into without slicing his own fingers in the process. 

"Because Rimthalien Aloevan is very good at his job." Vanya was making a copy of the marks on the ground that surrounded the edge of the dais, "that was a negotiation position, he was trying to get better rates for his people to stay in the village and by making it seem like there was a real danger that we had faced, maybe even get to trade at premium markup. These letters look like draconic, can you read them?" She nudged Lyra with her elbow.

"Oh wow" it just dawned on Lyra that she had no idea how the world outside of Hatfield worked and the scales began to fall from her eyes and then another realization that she had been asked a question, "Um, what? No, they look very, very old, not like what I was taught. Oh wait, I have an idea." She set the lantern on the dais, then put her hands together, opened them up like a book and said, "**Hanya i lammi.**" Then she placed her hands on the raised stone platform, looked at the words for a minute, "*Before the Great Fire comes, the peaks shall know a thousand kings.* I think it is a ward of some sort. But what are those lines of copper for?"
 
Korralan pointed at Athel, "Don't put that away, you and I are going to go make sure the rest of this place is empty."

"Is that blood" Aethel exclaimed. He was pointing at the top of the southern wall of the chamber they had entered. There was a faded mural depicting scenes of warfare in the mountains. In a very grandiose manner there were armies within snow-capped peaks. In the air above them, red, blue and white dragons were depicted hovering,  swooping, and even spitting fire at the conflicts below them. One panel showed dwarfs and humans dressed in similar liveried armor, fighting a common foe. At the very top, obviously not part of the original artist's vision were the words Aethel was pointing at. Large scrawled letters which spelled out, "UNCOVER YOUR TEARS."

"Looks like it," Korralan assessed, "Also looks like this picture is of a really old battle."

"Why do you say that?" Aethel was curious to know, and also a little encouraged that the taciturn dwarf was deciding to speech with him instead of just marching through this little exercise of clearing the rooms.

"The way the armor is hanging on these dwarfs," he pointed with the head of his axe at a particularly large figure in the foreground of the painting. "We haven't constructed armor like that in five or six centuries."

"So, I guess I mean, how do you know that? I mean what makes you such an expert on armor," Aethel tentatively posed his question, "I am just curious."

Korralan, leveled his eye at the young elf, "Before I was a Soulcrusher, I had to make arms and armor. I had to grind out the edges of swords and axes, I had to learn the ways of our smiths so that I could correct those who were not doing it properly. This means I had to study all the techniques of history and know why we adapted our methods because sometimes there is a smith who is overly curious about these things and wants to do things a different way."

"Oh." was all that the bard could respond with.

"I also had to learn about things like these symbols here," Korralan gestured at several different sigils scattered about the room, "and be able to know that these are for old gods with names like Belenus, Apep, Oghma, and Ares."

"I know those names, there are tales we tell and sing about them," almost instinctively his hand drifted towards his lute, but because he was still carrying the unsheathed new sword, he seemed to realize that this was not a moment of invitation to sing, so he half-heartedly added  "I'll play some later."

Satisfied that there were no bandits left hiding in this chamber, Korralan returned to the passageway, with Aethel sticking right behind him. The passed through  the Hall of Broken Blades, and once again Aethel's eyes keep drifting to the tarnished silver chalice. It gave him an awful sense of foreboding that it was something really ghoulish and disturbed his mind every time he glanced at it, but could not keep himself from doing so. Yt he gestured in that direction. "So i looked at that tablet earlier, it mentions a sepulcher for a knight where the three valleys converge."

"You sound like the human woman." Korralan rumbled.

"What do you mean?" Aethel innocently quipped.

"So fascinated with the ancient past, when we have real problems in the now." The dwarf explained.

"Oh, right, I just thought, you'd be interested to know." As they reached the door that they had entered the stronghold, the dwarf set about to lift it back into place, to at least cover most of the hole but it was too damaged and finished splintering into pieces as he lifted it off the ground. With obvious frustration, the dwarf threw the shard which had fallng off in his hand through the doorway where it spun and clattered along the stones.

Then he picked up his axe and heading deeper into the passageway beyond the door. Once again, leaving Aethel standing there scratching his head in amazement. "So why did you leave the mines?" the elf lobbing the question at the receding dwarf's back as he started after him. "Was it because everything was falling apart around you down there?"

"No" Korallan grunted when the elf caught up to him, "Everything was not falling apart around me, but we weren't making anything any more."

"You mean the smiths were all crushed out?" Intentionally goading the dwarf a bit, Aethel was trying to get more out of him than grunts and groans. To their left a set of stairs descended and to their right the hall way turned once again. Heading down the stairs, Korallan began to explain, "The Smith working just fine, the mines were working just fine, my father was trying to get himself more political power with the" pausing at the bottom of the stairs as there was now a door to their right which was the only place that this was going. Korralan shouldered it open and strode into the chamber with his axe at the ready.

The room was obviously were soldiers had eaten meals and gathered their arms. There were empty racks for weapons lining two of the walls, vast storage jars sealed by the Iron Valley Consortium line one of the other walls. There was however no one alive in the vast room and the dwarf quickly turned on his heel and headed back up the stairs. 

"With the who?" Aethel peppered him further. But Korralan ignored him heading quickly through the hallway. There was a light up ahead that was not part of the stronghold, and this gave both of them a charge of energy as they prepared for the worst. The reached a door in the left wall where the light was pouring out, and rush in. 

Vanya was poking her dagger at a kobold which was stumbling away from her, while Lyra was taking turns battering two different bandits on their lizard like heads. A fourth one was trying to flee deeper into the room where a great stone table was on a raised platform. There were faded banners hanging along all the walls but Korralan did not pause to look at the room around him, instead he went into action. Fiercely chopping and hacking with his axe the small lizard folks were swiftly dealt mighty death blows. The whirlwind of motion that the dwarf exhibited was anything but civilized; pure barbaric power overcoming the problem with a solution based entirely in steel and muscle.  

"We could have interviewed them" Vanya actually was refraining herself from laughter. 

"And what would we find out from them?" Aethel asked. 

Lyra huffed, "Anything. We could have found out anything but now we have to do all the work ourselves."

Reaching under neath the table from where he stood next to the platform, Korralan picked up a piece of parchment, moved to wipe his axe off with it but glanced at what was on it first, then he paused. Then handing it out to Vanya, "Do you think they would have told you what this is for?"

Vanya took the proffered parchment scrap and studied it for a minute before speaking, "No I don't think that they would have any idea what the Dusk Court is."

"Neither do we." Aethel offered.

"I have heard plenty of rumors in this valley of a place older than this one, wait what is that?" She pointed under the table at a scroll case sealed on both ends with wax. Lyra scrambled up on the platform, scooped it up and cracked one end and out tumbled a roll of parchment leaves. As she went to spread them out on the stone table, she noticed that there were deep scratches on its surface that all seemed to make up a map. "There's a map up here."

They all gathered and Vanya traced out the river's path from the Infernal Road up to a marked stronghold on the table's surface. Then holding the fragment in her hand next to it. "I believe we now know exactly where the Dusk Court is located. And it is on our way towards the Roadmarker."

# 10
The next morning the Dragon's Breathe did not cloud the peaks of the glacier opposite them, however the view of the path they had run up the previous day unfolded a vista which if they peered at the right spot on the northern horizon offered a glimpse of the glacier on which the Roadmarker of Sundering was perched. If they had better vision or optical instruments which would enhance their vision, they might have been able to make out the black stone monument dotting the central flat of the glacier. As it was, the path downhill from the Den of Ghesh-Balor was decidedly easier than their climb up to it. Especially as this time they were not being chased by a gang of kobold bandits. 

"You did say that it would take them a few days to figure out that they outnumbered us, so why are we leaving so soon?" Lyra questioned Vanya as they made their way through the deciduous forest lining the mountainside, "it seemed like we had much more to figure out bout this place."

"It will be a few days before the kobolds get brave enough to come back, but we don't want to be here when they do." Vanya was plainly working out her argument as she navigated the pathway, "What we learned about Ghesh-Balor was very interesting and will be quite valuable information when we get someplace that we can trade it. But the most important thing we learned about the Dragonborn Warlord was that he raided other older ruins for a great deal of his initial wealth

"Who will pay gold pieces for information?" Aethel was slightly incredulous at this news.

"You would be surprised at how much platinum the right buyer will pay just to know what we have discovered." The green clad human lit up a very convincing smile as she replied. In fact, that copper ingot that Korralan is carrying is going to be worth quite a bit more because it is stamped with the name of an ancient trade group which no longer exists. Aethel's head bounced between her face and the dwarf who was plodding behind of every one. He was quite laden with a large metal slab on his back, but his strength was such that he did not seem to notice its weight.

"There, where the river begins to divert away from the road, is where the maps showed we should go." Vanya gestured. Lyra spotted a path that seemed to be in the brush and left the road. The whole party followed along as they traversed through the cold tundra. Having left the road, there were more rocks and brush to avoid so the path was harder to travel. Aethel keep looking back behind them, the expression on his face appeared the his was not too pleased to be of the beaten track and into the brush. Each time they got further and further away from the road, his expression grew more and more concerned.

"Are you okay?" Lyra had noticed his concerns and eased up next to him to gently check.

"yeah, I am fine, It's just," Aethel kept moving forward, following behind Vanya who had now taken the lead, 'Its just, well, I keep thinking I see someone behind us.'

"You mean other than our chatty social member?" Lyra lightly joked in a way that was only for the benefit of her brother's ease. Korralan was actually starting to fall further behind. 

"Yeah, other than him." Aethel grimaced, "It's like a dark shape that pops in and out of view every so often." This time when he glanced behind him, Korralan had stopped in his tracks and was just standing in between two bushes. He set down the metal ingot and freed his axe. Aethel then began to walk toward the dwarf, resting his hand on the hilt of his newly acquired sword. 

"Vanya," Lyra hissed, and when she caught the eye of the other woman, gestured with her head at the me. Vanya heaved a big sigh and turned back to wards them as well. Before she and Lyra had gotten within fifteen feet of the other pair, a stout and weathered dwarf wearing a blackened leather cloak over tattered red and ash-grey robes stepped out from behind one of the small trees further away. 

"There's no need for that sort of greeting, Friends" his guttural voice scratchd and cracked the way molten lava pops when it is plunged into the sea. "I saw you lot leave the Infernal Route and thought I would catch you sooner. Name is Grimnar. 

"Hallo Grimnar," Aethel as ever was cheery when greeting a stranger, as his experience thus far had only taught him that he was only moments away from singing them a song and gaining several of their coins. 

"What can we do you for you stranger?" Vanya's voice was more defensive and restrained. "we are far off the road, and you have come this far."

"That's right. I am a simple cleric and on what you might call a holy mission." the dark dwarf unfolded his hands and spread them out before him is what seemed to be a peaceful gesture of openness. Korralan just stared at his face, watching closely every muscle movement, the way the coal-black beard with its intricate ember-orange streak patterns moved with his chin. Th former miner's gripe tightened on his axe handle, however the mysterious cleric was completely unperturbed. "I am visiting all the old ruins, of which there are many in this valley, and even dragon lairs, seeking a lost relic of my order."

"What sort of relic?" Lyra was watching the way that Vanya moved carefully forward as she entered negotiation demeanor. 

"It is a sacred book describing the true history of this valley, written in several different languages, Dwarf, Elf, and Draconic " Grimnar's eyes grew intense and unwavering as he spoke. "It is my greatest desire to retrieve it so that we may further spread the word of truth about the world."

"There are many words for truth, not all of them are to be believed" Korralan seemed to have taken the final measure of the stranger and come to a decision for the whole party. "We are not really interested in more deceptions."

The expression on Grimnar's face flashed dark and dangerous for a moment and then returned to his peaceful still presentation. "I apologize for interfering in your business. I shall not delay you further. However, I do wonder if you know of the location of any dragon lairs?"

"I am sure if you have been out here for a while you know of the Bronze wyrmling who has moved into the the Palace of Aria on the Infernal Route before you reach the Roadmarker of Sundering." Vanya tossing information out like a lure.

"indeed thank you. May the road and the winds be in your favor, and may the cleansing fires find you worthy" The cleric then turned and began to move back towards the road once again. The whole party stood silently and still and watched him recieded into the distance, this time he seemed to be making it very obvious that he was choosing to be seen while he made his exit from their company. No one spoke until he had had been gone a quarter of an hour.

"So that was spooky." Lyra practically whispered, breaking their silence vigil.

"Emberborn" Korralan drily gruntd. The other three looked at him in surprise and anticipation that more might come forth from his lips. When there was nothing more he was going to say, Aethel chimed in, "Do you want to let the rest of us know what that means?"

Korralan looked at him with a stone expression that was unreadable, "They are a dragon cult."

"Even though we have been in that little village on a glacier our whole lives, both my brother and I have seen lots of dragons. How is a dragon cult such a bad thing? There are lots of weird things folk will worship and chase and believe" Lyra was sincerely curious and there was an air about her that invited only genuine responses.

"The Dominion is rift with cults who believe that dragons are gods, they serve them first and foremost and it weakens dwarf culture." Korralan stowed his axe, picked up the metal ingot and once again began to trod on towards their destination.
