Lyra ran.
The trail had ceased to be a trail in any civilized sense ten heartbeats ago. It was a scar up the mountainside, a suggestion of a path worn by goats, hunters, and desperate things with fewer choices than sense. Dirt gave way to loose scree; roots jutted from the slope like grasping fingers. Low evergreens and scrub twisted themselves into cramped shapes, clinging to thin pockets of soil on the stone’s skin.
Behind her, kobold voices yipped and howled. The sound bounced between trunks and boulders, so it was impossible to tell exactly how far back the nearest pursuers were. Sometimes the calls sounded right on her heels; sometimes they smeared into the general racket of the taiga. Either way, there were too many of them.
Her lungs burned. The air here tasted different than Hatfield’s. It was harsher, thinner, full of the cold breath the glacier exhaled each dawn—what her father jokingly called Dragon’s Breath. Above, the Riellis peaks loomed, their jagged crowns lost in low cloud. From the burg, those mountains had always been a distant wall. From here, they were no longer background; they were the world’s spine, rising up so steep and close that the sky felt pinched between stone.
The slope steepened. The thin path bent sharply around a stunted fir, climbed another shelf of rock, then angled toward the cliff proper—a massive grey face that rose straight up in a single, terrifying sweep. It was the same mountain Lyra had watched the sun strike every morning of her life. Seeing it from the side like this, with no roofs or chimneys between her and its flank, made her stomach lurch.
How am I here? she thought, for the span of a single breath. I am supposed to be in Hatfield’s square, reading lists and stirring stew, not…

The clearing opened abruptly, a raw scrape of bare ground and broken roots tucked against the mountain’s flank. Lyra burst into it at a run and nearly collided with her brother. Aethel stood in the center of the space, head tipped back, eyes fixed upward.

The cliff face towered above them, a sheer sweep of stone that rose and twisted into an enormous buttress supporting the higher slopes. Up close, the bulk of the Riellis range felt different than it did from Hatfield’s square. From the burg, the mountains were a distant wall, a painted backdrop to daily life. Here, with her boots on their side and her breath frosting in their shadow, Lyra felt like an ant pressed against the ribs of some sleeping beast.

For a heartbeat, she forgot about the yipping cries of the kobolds somewhere below. She thought of all the mornings she had watched this particular peak catch the first light, wondering what lay on its far side. She had never imagined she would stand on its skin while running for her life.

“There,” Korralan said.

His voice snapped her focus back. He lifted his axe and pointed toward the base of the cliff, where a narrow crevice broke the smooth stone. At some point, the crack had been widened by tools: pick marks and chisel lines marred its edges, turning a natural weakness into a deliberate passage.

Lyra’s face flushed hot with embarrassment. She had been staring at the impossible height of the rock, thinking only of how thoroughly it blocked their way, and had almost missed the only possible route.

The kobolds’ cries rose again, echoing through the trees. They had slowed, but not stopped; the sound had a greedy edge now, the yip of hunters who have driven their quarry into a corner.

Vanya followed the line of Korralan’s axe and did not hesitate. She darted toward the crevice, slipping between its narrow walls. The others surged after her.

The passage bent once, twice, the air cooling further as the cliff swallowed them. Then, almost without warning, the tight squeeze opened.

They stepped into a courtyard carved from the mountain’s heart.

It was not a natural hollow. The floor had been leveled, the walls smoothed and squared in places, then allowed to curve toward the north, where the stone reared back into a massive arch. Every surface bore the marks of tools wielded by patient, skilled hands long ages ago. Lichen had begun to creep back in, a thin grey‑green veil over craftsmanship, but it could not conceal the intent: this was an entrance, meant to impress and intimidate.

Lyra’s gaze followed the curve of the courtyard up to the arch itself. Her breath caught.

A dragon’s head loomed over them, hewn directly from the cliff. Its features were stylized rather than naturalistic—angular ridges, exaggerated horns, eyes like deep‑cut pits—but the overall effect was unnerving. The mouth gaped in a wide sneer, stone lips peeled back to reveal fangs that jutted down in jagged pairs. Within that maw, the rock had been carved into an elaborate staircase.

The tongue.

It flowed upward from the courtyard floor into the shadowed throat, each “taste bud” a carefully shaped step. Flanking it, carved gums and teeth provided a twisted sort of balustrade. To walk up those stairs was to walk into the dragon’s mouth.

“A welcoming committee,” Aethel muttered under his breath, but his voice lacked its usual flippancy.

They ascended the tongue, boots thudding on stone that had been worn smooth in the center and remained sharp at the edges. As Lyra climbed, she noticed two teeth midway along the upper jaw that were different from the others. Each was carved thicker, more cylindrical, and each bore a massive keyhole bored through its tip.

The openings were so large she thought, with a shudder, that she might be able to fit her head through one if she tried. Coppery stains streaked down from the bottom of each hole, dried in old rivulets across the tooth’s length and into the carved gum.

“Blood?” Aethel asked quietly.

“Or something meant to look like it,” Vanya replied. “Iron and copper can leave marks like that when the surface is treated. But someone wanted visitors to think of bleeding teeth.”

At the back of the throat, past the last ridges of stylized palate, a set of double doors filled the space. They gleamed dully in the half‑light: metal, not wood. On the angled walls to either side, smaller single doors—wood bound in iron bands—waited in shadow.

Massive runes had been carved into the stone around the central doors, then inlaid in dark metal. The script was old, but not wholly unfamiliar. Lyra had traced similar characters in her mother’s copy of the Master Chronicle and in a battered tablet Seldiesal kept wrapped in cloth under the bed.

She stepped closer and squinted, lips moving as she pieced the sentence together.

“Here dwells the Iron‑Fisted, whose copper tears flow eternal,” she read aloud.

Aethel turned from the doors. “What did you just say?”

She pointed up. “That is what it says over the door.”

“That is thoroughly unsettling,” he said. “Both the message and the fact that you can read… whatever that is.”

“Old Draconic,” Lyra said. “Mother says it was favored by warlords who wanted dragons to pay attention to their inscriptions. Or by dragons who wanted mortals to feel small.”

Vanya had already produced her notebook. She scribbled furiously, capturing the phrasing, the curve of the letters, the position of the key‑teeth relative to the main door. Her quill tip flicked as she added a brief notation: “Iron‑Fisted? Possible title of Ghesh‑Balor? See Ash and Iron appendix.”

“These doors are iron,” she said, tapping the metal, “but they have been given an old treatment—chemical and chanted both, by the look of it—to patina them like copper. Aesthetic, and symbolic. Copper tears, copper tribute. The War of Ash and Iron texts talk about fortress‑lords who taxed in ingots instead of coin. This could be one of theirs.”

Korrallan ran his calloused hand over the surface, eyes narrowing. “We sometimes use a similar technique in the mines,” he said. “For decorative armor, parade helms. It is difficult to do correctly. These…” He let out a low whistle. “These are masterpieces.”

He set his palm flat against one of the door leaves, testing its give. There was none. He shifted his weight, braced, and gave a careful shove. Nothing moved.

“They will not open without a key,” he said. “Not easily. And I do not fancy trying to out‑wrestle a dragon’s mouth.”

He kept his hand there a moment longer, frown deepening. Then he snatched it back as if bitten.

“Why are they so cold?” he asked.

He held his palm over the surface again without touching it, as if feeling for heat. “The metal is humming,” he added after a moment, tilting his head. “Low. Here.”

Curiosity overrode fear. Aethel swung his lute down from his back, thumb brushing the strings. He tuned by habit, then began to pluck through intervals, searching for the note that had set Korralan’s teeth on edge. With a few quick adjustments, he plucked and tuned until he found the note that matched the faint vibration in his bones. When he hit it, the resonance with the door made the hair on Lyra’s arms stand up.

“That one,” he said. “Whatever these doors are connected to, it is awake. Or at least aware.”

“There are scratches here,” Lyra said, stepping to the side and running her fingers over a less formal patch of stone. “In Common.”

Someone—many someones, over time—had carved words at waist height, gouging letters into the frame where the formal Draconic inscription did not reach.

“‘Beware the Iron Fist,’” she read. “And over here— ‘The Peaks remember.’”

“The Peaks?” Aethel straightened. “As in the Three Peaks?”

He brightened as if someone had plucked his favorite string. “There is a tavern song about that. The miners loved it. ‘Fear the Storm Reapers, for their swords cast lightning—’” He slapped his hands on his thighs to mark the rhythm. “Boom, boom. ‘We drink to the Three Peaks, boom, boom, we drink to the Three Peaks—’”

He launched into the tune, voice rising to fill the dragon’s throat. The refrain rolled out, echoing faintly against stone teeth. He added, with gusto, “—‘may we never see them again!’”

When no one joined in, he let the song trail off, fingers defaulting back to the low, droning ostinato of the door’s hum.

“It is basically a drinking song about heroes who died to save the Three Peaks,” he said. “You know. Stirring nonsense.”

“The Three Peaks were no nonsense,” Korralan said. His voice had gone flat again, documentary. “Surface kingdom. Long before Hatfield. They stood against incursions from the Shadowfell—held the line between this side of the Emberspine and things that should not have crossed. Six hundred years ago, they lost.”

He glanced up at the inscription. “Their fall left room for Ignarath the Scorched Tyrant to rise. The Master Chronicle says as much, if you can find the uncensored copy.”

“Oh, that epic,” Aethel said, and his fingers immediately tried to shape the opening of another tune. “It starts with—”

“Now is not the time for ‘The Dragon’s Balls Are Fire,’” Lyra said sharply. “No matter how many times you have forced the White Warrior to hear it.”

“That song,” Vanya said, looking up from her notes, “I do know. It circulates on the Infernal Route, though the verses change depending on who is singing and which dragon they have decided to offend this season.”

Her expression sobered as she glanced back toward the courtyard. The kobolds’ cries had grown louder, closer. The stone walls muted the sound, but could not erase it.

“We should find a way inside,” she said. “If this is what I think it is—if this is the Den of Ghesh‑Balor—then the bandits will not expect anyone to take shelter here. They use it as a nest, not a battleground.”

“Ghesh‑Balor,” Lyra repeated. The name rang a bell from her mother’s bedtime stories and from a footnote in the Book Outline. “He was a warlord, was he not? Before Ash and Iron?”

“A petty tyrant by the standards of the dragons,” Vanya said. “But significant enough here. His stronghold was said to be cursed, later. Bandits always return to cursed places. They think old evils will scare away competition.”

Korralan had already shifted his attention from the central doors to the side entrances. He moved to the wooden door on the right, running his hand over the grain, the iron bands, the hinges.

“Less impressive,” he said. “But more practical.”

He took a half step back, squared himself, and swung his axe.

The blade bit into the wood with a solid thunk. Splinters flew. The impact jolted up his arms, but he did not flinch. He swung again, and again, each blow chewing through hinges and jamb. On the fourth strike, the wood around the top hinge cracked. On the fifth, the lower band snapped with a screech of protesting metal.

The door sagged inward, then fell with a crash into darkness beyond.

“If anyone complains,” Aethel said, unable to resist, “we can say we knocked.”

Korralan did not dignify that with a response. He stepped into the doorway, axe raised, eyes narrowing as they adjusted to interior gloom. The faint light from the dragon’s mouth spilled over his shoulders and into the space beyond, revealing only a few paces of worn stone floor and the hint of a corridor leading deeper into the mountain.

The air that flowed out to meet them was cooler than the courtyard, with a stale undertone—old dust and older stone, touched by the faint tang of something metallic and sour. The light from the dragon’s mouth only reached a few paces inside before being swallowed by shadow.

“Goodness gracious, hmm, hmm, hmm, goodness gracious…” Aethel hummed under his breath as he slung his lute to his back again. The nonsense syllables bounced off the carved throat in a nervous little echo.

“Are you coming or what?” Lyra called from just inside the threshold.

Aethel drew his rapier in one smooth motion. The blade whispered free, catching a last glint of grey light from the courtyard before the mountain swallowed it. He tested the balance—not because he doubted it, but because the familiar motion steadied his hands.

Then, with as much dignity as one could manage when fleeing into an ancient warlord’s lair to avoid being torn apart by kobolds, he stepped over the threshold after the others and into the waiting dark of the Den of Ghesh‑Balor.
