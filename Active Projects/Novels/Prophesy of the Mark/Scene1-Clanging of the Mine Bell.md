Excitement danced through the air, jumping from one resident to the next as word spread that a caravan was winding its way up the glacial switchbacks toward Hatfield. On the lip of the plateau, children took turns scrambling to the overlook, calling down the count of wagons until they gave up trying to find the end of the line. By the time the bright star above reached its hard, cold zenith, the first ox teams would be rolling into the square. Midday was always the best time for a caravan to arrive. Morning chores could be finished, miners could emerge from the copper veins for a mid‑shift meal, and the entire village could turn itself toward trade for a few precious hours.

For a place like Hatfield, that meant more than novelty. Food stores were low. Baoscott’s Trade Post shelves had been stripped down to sacks of grain, rough tools, and a few pitted blades. Peat piles were shrinking; fruit and anything fresh had vanished from cupboards weeks ago. On most days, the village clung stubbornly to the glacier by the wages paid for the bright orange ore dragged from the deep and the Ember Spirits’ favor the Flamewardens swore protected the miners. On caravan days, it felt—for a little while—like the world remembered this isolated burg existed.

Children tugged at their mothers’ sleeves, jittering on nerves already frayed by thin sleep and thinner larders. The women hushed them as best they could while mentally tallying coin and necessities. Some, the lucky or ruthless few, had pinched gold for years to send a child to one of the village tutors, buying a chance that their sons or daughters might someday read contracts instead of ore weights. Everyone else planned how many candles and how much flour they could afford before the next stretch of lean uncertainty.

At the east edge of town, Seldiesal Sol‑astra hurried across the packed‑snow square with her healer’s kit tucked under one arm. The big stone building of the Local Watch loomed ahead, squat and practical against the wind. She had just come from a sick miner’s hut—a man genuinely ill, not merely nursing a hangover or a bruised pride. She had brewed herbs, checked his lungs, and, when the coughing fits did not ease, quietly let a fragment of power trickle through her hands. Hatfield might be a company town built for ore, not comfort, but its overseers paid her a sliver of coin from their funds to keep as many bodies swinging picks as possible.

The town itself was run by dwarves from deeper in the mine, appointed by authorities Seldiesal had never seen but whose decisions she felt in every shortage and every extra shift. Hatfield existed as a surface market and staging post, little more. That understanding sat under every errand she ran. Today’s visit had taken longer; the dwarf in question could barely sit up. She told herself the extra effort was why her stride was so brisk as she reached for the Watch House door, not the low, familiar resentment she kept carefully behind her teeth.

“Brinyar had the culp,” she announced as she stepped into the dim warmth of the front office.

Riminion Helcral sat behind the high desk, shoulders hunched, scratching lines on a piece of parchment with a small, careful hand that did not match his scarred, blocky build. The squad leader did not look up immediately; his voice came rough and distracted.

“Make sure you shut that door tightly.”

Seldiesal nudged it closed with her heel and advanced to the desk. She heard the clink of coins as Riminion’s hand groped in a drawer and dropped a few silvery pieces on the edge without taking his eyes off the report he was finishing. His quill scratched a few more strokes before he paused.

“I had to cast,” she said, letting a bit more steel enter her tone than usual when talking about her rates.

That earned her a look. One bushy brow lifted. Riminion grunted, reached back into the drawer, and this time produced a heavier, yellow coin. He set it down with deliberate care. She caught it before it rolled, adding it to the small pile.

“I may have to return on the morrow,” she added. “It was not good.”

“If it comes to that, we’ll be sending Brother Loody,” Riminion replied. His voice sawed through the air, then cut off mid‑breath, as if he had used up his allotment of words for the hour. “Based off his remarks at Temple lately.”

“I am sure you know best.” Seldiesal did not press. There was no profit in getting dragged into the quiet tug‑of‑war between her practical healing and Ralilion Loody’s Ember‑Spirit sermons. For all his human frailty and fervor, the cleric cared about Hatfield’s people. The dwarves from the deep mines cared about quotas.

“Oh, if it isn’t my favorite elf!”

Durni Trueblood’s voice burst in from the side office a beat before he did. The Overseer had an uncanny knack for appearing in the middle of conversations, especially those involving coin leaving his authority’s coffers. He waddled forward, robe slightly too tight across the shoulders, beard gleaming with oil.

“I do believe you were saying it was the culp?” he said. “That usually passes quickly, especially after you have worked your magic, hmm?”

“Aye, it does with the young ones,” Seldiesal answered evenly, “but Brinyar has been going down into the vein for decades. His lungs are not what they used to be.”

“Oh, but we dwarves are a hardy lot. We can dig for a century or more.” His beard hid his mouth, his eyes doing the smiling for him, small and bright and hard to read. “I am certain old Mister Ironsleeves will be swinging his pick as heartily as ever tomorrow.” He slid the drawer fully shut with a little thump, punctuation to his optimism. “That is, if he does not have too much to drink tonight at the White Warrior Inn. The traders will want a little merriment, once they are settled, eh?”

Seldiesal’s lips pressed thin to dam up her first three replies. “Aye,” she said instead. “I will likely be very busy in the morning. I should head to the house and rest while I can.”

She swept the coins into her purse and turned for the door.

“Make sure you close that door properly,” Riminion barked as she left.

Outside, the air knifed at her cheeks, crisp and dry. From here, Hatfield was a short run of packed‑snow street and clustered buildings, with the western edge of town visible in a straight shot where the road climbed up from the switchbacks. The glacier’s top had been leveled there decades ago, just enough space for a square, a few rows of houses, the mine mouths, and the massive bell on its timber frame in the center of the square.

The first wagons were just now rolling into view at the western boundary—broad‑wheeled carts pulled by steam‑breathing oxen whose flanks steamed in the cold. Villagers converged on them in a hungry tide of wool and leather. Seldiesal walked toward the commotion, letting the murmur of voices and bursts of laughter wash over her.

Everyone was running low. Everyone knew it. Excitement sharpened by need hummed in the air. The size of this caravan only stoked it further; there were more wagons than Hatfield usually saw in a whole season, and they were coming down from the north, where the Zhulmar Dominion’s reach brushed the Etrivalian steppes and the Infernal Route ran a thousand miles back to Dhodh‑La. Gods knew what news and goods these traders carried.

The first cart halted where road met square. The driver swung down to tend to his team, and Seldiesal slipped around the wagon’s flank to avoid the knot of children trying to pet the oxen. At the back of the boxy cabin, a narrow door swung open. A man bounded out onto the little platform as if it were a stage.

“Hallo, everybody! Did you miss us?”

His greeting rolled over the crowd, polished and precise. Seldiesal guessed he had trained his voice in better halls than these at some point, then traded theatres for trade roads. His face bore the long weathering of travel, but a genuine joy lit it from within as he swept his arms wide.

Seldiesal’s gaze skipped past him to her daughter. Lyra stood a little apart from the crowd, as she often did, shoulders drawn in as if any sudden movement might unspool her thoughts. Her eyes flicked across faces, gestures, the angle of wagon wheels—watching, cataloguing. One hand hovered near the satchel where her little book lay, fingers twitching in the familiar battle between the urge to take notes and the awareness that scribbling in the middle of greetings would mark her as odd. Seldiesal moved to stand beside her, offering silent solidarity.

The jolly caravan leader produced a lute from somewhere within the wagon and struck up an eager tune. As each new wagon rumbled in and stopped, the crowd shifted, splitting its enthusiasm between the music and the practical business of seeing what was for sale. Already, a loose pattern formed as people gravitated back to favorite carts—Baoscott arguing prices with a spice merchant, children giggling at a crate of strange toys, miners looking longingly at a rack of sturdier boots.

“Well, that does it,” Lyra muttered under her breath. “Aethel is definitely going to want to leave with this group.”

She chuckled, a small sound threaded with relief and worry. Seldiesal stole a sideways glance at her daughter’s face and saw a familiar knot of emotions: pride in her twin, fear for him, and a quiet hope that at least one of her children might step beyond this glacier safely.

“If they’ll have his pomposity,” Seldiesal replied dryly. “That one there might find Aethel too much competition to keep along on a months‑long journey.”

Lyra snorted, then caught her mother’s eye. They both laughed softly, the shared joke easing a little of the tension coiled in their shoulders.

“Oh—look. Our fearless Overseer,” Lyra said, tipping her chin toward the Watch House.

Durni Trueblood had indeed emerged, the front door left yawning open behind him. He trotted across the square at a pace that seemed almost comical, his short legs churning, arms pumping twice as fast, beard held rigid by oil like a shield before him. He reached the edge of the first wagon just as the caravan leader hopped down into the throng.

“We almost did not come up here!” the man proclaimed, voice rising above the music and chatter. The lute hung at his side now like a prop between scenes. “That gang of kobolds just past the river crossing harassed us all the way to the turnoff. A smaller, less protected caravan would not risk the slow climb to your lovely little hamlet.”

The words fell like a sudden gust. The crowd’s excitement faltered into anxious murmurs. The idea of caravans choosing not to make the climb—the idea of Hatfield being bypassed—punched straight through the village’s fragile sense of security. Faces tightened as people did the mental arithmetic of empty shelves and longer winters.

Durni had slowed as soon as he caught the word “kobolds.” He pushed through the villagers to plant himself in front of the caravan leader, puffed up with official indignation.

“Kobolds?” he said. “By the river crossing? But we have patrols…”

His voice trailed off, the last word unraveling as the implication sank in: patrols had not been enough. Or had not been where they were supposed to be. Around him, people fell quiet, waiting to see if he would promise action or dismiss the complaint.

The answer came from somewhere else entirely.

The Mine Bell began to clang.

The sound exploded through the square, deep and insistent, so loud it seemed to rattle the frost from the eaves. This was not the sharp, workaday bell the miners used to mark shift changes and emergencies deeper in the Hatfield shafts. This was the other bell—the great iron weight in the exact center of the square that had been installed when a troop of Deep Dwarves had first emerged from Zhulmar’s lowest workings and asserted their authority over the surface burg.

There was no visible rope to pull it. No one in Hatfield was quite sure where, exactly, the mechanism connected. They only knew that when it rang, it meant something extraordinary had begun far below their feet. Many had lived here for years. Few could recall hearing it at all. None had heard it like this: a measured, relentless toll that turned the air to iron.

The sound cut through every conversation. It pinned limbs in place. The responses among Hatfield’s people were nearly universal; they froze where they stood, eyes snapping toward the bell as if to confirm that yes, it was really moving. Children clamped their hands over their ears. A dog started barking madly, then yelped and dove under a wagon. The only ones who seemed to move easily under the sound were the caravaners, Durni, and the dwarves in the Watch House.

From across the square came Riminion Helcral’s voice, magnified by long practice on parade grounds.

“Up and at it, you lazy good‑for‑nothings!”

Another toll of the bell.

“Dress armor! Don it now!”

Clang.

“You pathetic little twits, fall out and muster in the square!”

The raw recruits of the Mine Guard scrambled into motion, some stumbling as the bell’s vibration seemed to shake their knees. This—Seldiesal knew, watching Riminion stride into the open—was exactly the sort of moment the battered old soldier was built for. His life had been one long preparation for bad news delivered by bells and horns. Now, he moved with a frightening efficiency, snapping orders, pointing troopers toward the armory racks where ceremonial helms and polished breastplates had hung gathering dust.

Durni Trueblood’s face, already pale from the kobold news, lost what color remained. He turned slowly away from the caravan leader, ignoring the man’s attempt to keep arguing.

“Hey! I’m telling you, if you don’t fix this, your tiny little isolated town is going to fall off the map!” the trader shouted after him.

The Overseer’s steps were mechanical, directed more by fear and habit than conscious choice. Whatever was happening below, whatever had prompted the bell, clearly mattered more to his position than any merchant’s threat. The bell’s steady tolling seemed to pace his movement as he crossed the square back toward the mine.

Riminion had already managed, in those few ringing moments, to get two parallel lines of armored dwarves formed up outside the Grand Mine Entrance. Most days, Hatfield’s miners used a smaller side mouth, a rough‑cut opening in the rock that led directly into the familiar shafts. The massive, iron‑bound double doors at the main entrance remained closed, a symbolic throat connecting to deeper, more secret workings that did not concern Hatfield.

Today, those doors were the focus of every eye.

Guards adjusted grips on their axes, the new‑polished metal catching cold light with each movement. Banners that most villagers had only seen rolled and stowed snapped as they were unfurled, strange sigils flashing briefly in the air before settling. Riminion took his place at the center of the formation, broad back to the doors, gaze scanning the square to ensure the gauntlet was straight and every trooper’s stance correct.

Seldiesal felt Lyra step closer to her, almost unconsciously. The healer’s own chest tightened. She had known, in a quiet, unspoken way, that the deep authorities could reach up and change Hatfield’s fate in a single decision. Hearing the bell was proof that someone below had pulled on that invisible rope.

“What does it mean?” Lyra asked, voice barely audible under the next crash of sound.

“It means,” Seldiesal said, eyes on the mine doors, “that something from the deep has decided to visit us.”

The bell tolled again, then again, slower now, like the last beats of a heart before something new begins.

Durni reached the end of the guard lines and slotted himself into place between them, trying to arrange his features into an expression of solemn authority. Riminion gave him a curt nod without taking his eyes off the doors.

As the bell’s final echo rolled away across the glacier, a different sound rose in its place: the low, shuddering creak of ancient hinges bearing a great weight. The massive doors of the Grand Mine Entrance began to move, stone and timber groaning as a seam of darkness widened between them. Cold, stale air breathed out from the depths, tasting of iron and secret decisions.

Nearly the entire village, and half the caravan besides, held its breath as the opening widened, waiting to see what—or who—the deep mines were sending up into the thin, hard light of Hatfield’s square.
