## What Is Edge?

Edge is the single situational modifier (-5 to +5, typically -3 to +3) that captures:
- Archetype advantages (+1-2)
- Domain expertise (+1-2)  
- Tree node bonuses (+1-2)
- Situational factors (+/-1-3)

**Don't stack endlessly** — discuss the situation and agree on ONE Edge number.
