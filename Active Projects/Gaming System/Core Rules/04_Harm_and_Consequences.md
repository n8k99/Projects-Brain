# Harm and Consequences
## Health, Wounds, Armor, and Moral Stress

On Orbis, characters are hard to kill by random chip damage but vulnerable to bad Position, serious injuries, and moral strain.

## Health Points (HP)

HP represents your capacity to stay functional: dodges, near-misses, bruises.

- Typical adventurer: **10-20 HP** (based on Body and culture)
- At **0 HP**: You drop, gain a Wound, or must retreat

### HP Recovery

- **Short rest** (1-2 hours): Restore some HP
- **Full rest** (overnight): Restore most/all HP

## Wounds

Wounds are named conditions, not negative numbers:

- **Light Wound**: Painful but manageable (days to heal)
- **Serious Wound**: Limiting (weeks or magic needed)
- **Critical/Mortal Wound**: Life-threatening (immediate intervention required)

A single hit can inflict a Wound in Desperate Position or from very powerful foes.

## Armor Protection Value (APV)

APV reduces incoming Harm before it hits HP:

- Light armor/cover: **APV 1-2**
- Solid armor/shields: **APV 3-5**
- Heavy fortifications/dragon scales: **APV 6+**

**Effective Harm = max(0, Raw Harm – APV)**

Some harm types (psychic, poison, anomalies) ignore or halve APV.

## Moral Stress: Resolve and Strain

Where HP tracks the body, Resolve and Strain track the mind and conscience.

- **Resolve**: Pool of moral stamina (spend to act against your ethics)
- **Strain**: Accumulated moral damage

### When You Act Against Your Moral Profile:

- **Weight 1 violation**: Spend 1 Resolve or gain 1 Strain
- **Weight 2 violation**: Spend 2 Resolve or gain 2 Strain
- **Weight 3 violation**: Spend 3 Resolve or gain 3 Strain

### At 3+ Strain:

- Disadvantage on Insight/Persuasion with your people
- -1 to conviction-based powers per 2 Strain
- Difficulty with Towers/Monuments that sense intent

### Recovery:

- **Resolve**: Slow recovery through rest and atonement
- **Strain**: Only drops through significant acts of repair, confession, or moral shift

## Combat Harm Quick Reference

| Position | HP Loss (typical) | Wound Risk |
|----------|------------------|------------|
| Controlled | 1-2 HP | Rare |
| Risky | 3-5 HP | Possible |
| Desperate | 7+ HP | Likely |
