# Magic/Tech Domain - The Thirteen Towers
## Monuments, Relics, Anomalies, and the Blurred Line Between Magic and Technology

---

## Domain Overview

**Core Question:** "How do the strange powers function and what can they do?"

**Sphere of Influence:** Monuments, relics, Tower phenomena, anomalies, and the "magical" infrastructure that's actually advanced technology from the Colony era.

**What Magic/Tech Characters Shape:**
- Which Monument functions are accessible
- How artifacts and relics are understood and used
- What Tower phenomena mean and how to respond
- Whether truth about technology vs magic spreads or stays hidden

---

## Magic/Tech Domain Philosophy

On Orbis, what most call "magic" is actually **Colony-era technology**:
- Monuments are fabricators, medical bays, quantum gates, data stores
- Towers are dormant starship vessels
- "Enchanted" items are Monument-manufactured tech
- Anomalies are system malfunctions or edge cases

Magic/Tech specialists navigate between:
- **Surface explanation:** Divine magic, Dragon power, ancient sorcery
- **Actual reality:** AI-maintained infrastructure, programmed systems

Mastery scales from:
- **Novice**: Use basic Monument functions
- **Journeyman**: Understand how Monuments work
- **Adept**: Manipulate Monument systems
- **Expert**: Comprehend Tower/Colony technology
- **Master**: Reverse-engineer lost capabilities
- **Apex**: Understand the system completely (dangerous)

The Magic/Tech domain intersects with:
- **+ Political:** Monument control as authority
- **+ Covert:** Stealing Monument knowledge, Tower intelligence
- **+ Martial:** Monument-forged weapons, Tower defenses
- **+ Spiritual:** Technology as theology
- **+ Economic:** Monument resource control

## Magic/Tech Domain Advancement Notes

**Typical Progression Pace:**
- Novice → Journeyman: Study and experimentation
- Journeyman → Adept: Major discovery or synthesis
- Adept → Expert: Systematic understanding
- Expert → Master: Mastery of technical systems
- Master → Apex: Complete comprehension (deadly knowledge)

**Multi-Tree Development:**
- Monument Research + Artifact Analysis = Technical Master
- Tower Functions + Chronicle Decipherment = System Archaeologist
- All Four Trees = The Gnostic Engineer (incredibly dangerous position)

**Domain Crossover Opportunities:**
- Magic/Tech + Covert = Monument Intelligence Specialist
- Magic/Tech + Political = Monument-Based Authority
- Magic/Tech + Martial = Monument Weapons Master
- Magic/Tech + Spiritual = Technology as Theology
- Magic/Tech + Economic = Artifact Trade Master

**The Magic/Tech Trap:**

This domain is uniquely dangerous because:
1. **Draconic Attention**: Tower/Monument research attracts Dragon scrutiny
2. **Forbidden Knowledge**: Truth about the system is actively suppressed
3. **Power vs Survival**: The more you know, the more Dragons see you as threat

High-tier Magic/Tech specialists face the dilemma:
- **Use knowledge** (become powerful but exposed)
- **Hide knowledge** (stay safe but limited)
- **Share knowledge** (transform society but trigger Dragon response)

**The Magic/Tech Endgame:**

Master/Apex Magic/Tech characters know the truth:
- They understand the system completely
- They could manipulate or break it
- Dragons know they know
- Survival requires extreme caution OR overwhelming leverage

They're not wizards. They're engineers who understand the machine civilization runs on—and that makes them either essential or expendable.

The question isn't "what can they do?" It's "what will Dragons let them do?"
