# Political Domain - The Thirteen Towers
## Authority, Legitimacy, and the Architecture of Power

---

## Domain Overview

**Core Question:** "Who holds power and why?"

**Sphere of Influence:** Authority structures, legitimacy, governance, treaties, alliances, and the formal mechanisms through which power is exercised and transferred.

**What Political Characters Shape:**
- Who is recognized as legitimate authority
- Which treaties and agreements bind realms
- How succession and power transfer occurs
- What political structures endure or collapse

---

## Political Domain Philosophy

Political power on Orbis is about **legitimacy and recognition**, not just raw force. A warlord with an army is just a bandit until others recognize their authority. Political specialists make and break rulers through the architecture of power itself.

Political mastery scales from:
- **Novice**: Local influence, minor favors
- **Journeyman**: Broker deals, represent factions
- **Adept**: Shape policy, influence rulers
- **Expert**: Make kings, break dynasties
- **Master**: Architect of political systems
- **Apex**: Redefine sovereignty itself

The Political domain intersects with every other domain:
- **+ Martial:** Military backing for political authority
- **+ Covert:** Blackmail, leverage, secret deals
- **+ Economic:** Trade treaties, economic dependencies
- **+ Spiritual:** Divine right, religious legitimacy
- **+ Magic/Tech:** Monument control as political power

## Political Domain Advancement Notes

**Typical Progression Pace:**
- Novice → Journeyman: Successful negotiations or political victories
- Journeyman → Adept: Build coalition or broker major deal
- Adept → Expert: Shape realm-level politics
- Expert → Master: Create lasting political institutions
- Master → Apex: Continental political impact

**Multi-Tree Development:**
Most successful Political characters combine trees:
- Diplomacy + Alliance Building = Coalition Diplomat
- Faction Navigation + Authority = Court Politician
- Alliance Building + Treaty Crafting = League Builder
- Authority + Legitimacy = Sovereign Ruler
- All Five Trees = The Statesman (rare, transformational)

**Domain Crossover Opportunities:**
- Political + Martial = Warlord-King, Political General
- Political + Covert = Shadow Kingmaker (blackmail-based authority)
- Political + Economic = Merchant Prince, Trade League Leader
- Political + Spiritual = Theocrat, Divine Right Ruler
- Political + Magic/Tech = Monument-Backed Authority

**Why This Matters:**

Political mastery isn't about force—it's about **legitimacy**. A Political domain master makes rulers, not through violence, but through recognition. When you hold Apex nodes, you define what "rightful authority" means.

In a world administered by Dragons who enforce treaties, Political domain specialists become essential. They:
- Navigate Dragon-imposed order
- Leverage treaty law as weapon
- Build coalitions Dragons must respect
- Define legitimacy in ways Dragons can't easily override

**The Political Endgame:**

By Master/Apex tier, Political characters don't serve rulers—they ARE the political reality rulers navigate. They've built institutions, written laws, forged alliances, and defined legitimacy itself.

They're not kingmakers. They're the reason kings exist at all.
