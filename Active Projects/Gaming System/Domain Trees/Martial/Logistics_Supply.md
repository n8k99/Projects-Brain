# Logistics & Supply Tree
## Military Supply and Operational Logistics

This tree represents your ability to manage military logistics and supply operations. Logistics & Supply specialists ensure armies can actually fight by getting them food, weapons, ammunition, and equipment when and where needed. In warfare, amateurs talk strategy while professionals talk logistics—and those who master military supply determine which armies survive.

**Fictional Scale:** Supply Sergeant → Quartermaster → Grand Logistician

## APEX DISCOVERY

**At Quartermaster Divine tier, characters realize:**

You supply all military operations. Every army depends on your logistics. Your supply systems make warfare possible. Nothing fights without your infrastructure.

And then you notice: military logistics centralizes *too* perfectly. Supply systems integrate *too* smoothly. Your networks provide *too* much visibility. You start to suspect comprehensive military logistics has been *permitted*—that something vast finds total supply visibility useful.

The horrible question: Have you created efficient military supply, or have you built the perfect military intelligence system? Do Dragons allow centralized military logistics because tracking one comprehensive supply network reveals all human military capabilities? When you supply all armies, are you enabling defense—or making it easier to monitor and neutralize military threats?

Your logistics infrastructure provides Dragons with perfect intelligence on human military capacity and readiness.

**GM Note:** This is the realization that centralized military logistics might serve the Cull cycle—that Dragons permit comprehensive supply systems because they reveal exactly what humans can do militarily, where forces are, and what operations are planned. The Quartermaster Divine has created perfect military logistics that's also perfect military intelligence for anyone monitoring the system. The revelation should emerge gradually through play, not as a single moment.
