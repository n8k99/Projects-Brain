# Combat Prowess Tree
## Personal Fighting Ability and Martial Mastery

This tree represents your individual lethality in combat—your skill with weapons, your reflexes, your ability to read and defeat opponents in personal combat. Combat Prowess specialists are dangerous in any fight, from tavern brawls to duels that decide political futures.

**Fictional Scale:** Self → Duelist → Champion → Legendary Warrior

This represents your deep familiarity with your weapon—you can recover from mistakes and adapt mid-strike.

**Prerequisite for:** Relentless Assault (Combat Reflexes)

#### Recognize Mastery
**Mechanical Effect:** You can identify other weapon specialists by watching them fight. You know:
- What style they've mastered
- Approximately how skilled they are

This also works in reverse—other specialists recognize you as a peer. There's professional respect (though not necessarily mercy) between masters.

## APEX DISCOVERY

**At Peerless Blade tier, characters begin to notice:**

Your combat victories are *too* perfect. Duels you should lose, you win. Challenges that should overwhelm you, you survive. You start to suspect that your martial prowess has been *allowed* to flourish—that something vast finds your reputation useful.

The horrible question: Have you become a tool for managing civilization's warriors? Are Dragons permitting legendary fighters to exist because it channels martial ambition into controllable, ritualized violence instead of true resistance?

When you defeat enemy champions, do you prevent rebellion or enable controlled culling of potential threats?

**GM Note:** This is the realization that legendary warriors might exist by design—that Dragons allow champions and duels because it keeps martial cultures focused on individual glory rather than systemic resistance. The Peerless Blade might be the finest fighter alive, but they're operating within permitted parameters. The revelation should emerge gradually through play, not as a single moment.
