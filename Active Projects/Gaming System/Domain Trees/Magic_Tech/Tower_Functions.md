# Tower Functions Tree
## Understanding Tower Phenomena and Systems

This tree represents your ability to understand, observe, and potentially interact with Tower systems. Towers are dormant Colony-era starships—the vessels that brought humanity to Orbis. Tower Functions specialists navigate the most dangerous knowledge on the planet: understanding what the Towers actually are and how they work. This knowledge is profoundly dangerous—Dragons monitor Tower research closely, and certain discoveries attract terminal attention.

**Fictional Scale:** Tower Observer → Tower Researcher → Tower Systems Expert

---

## Tower Watcher (Novice Tier)

**Advancement Trigger:** Observe and systematically document Tower phenomena for at least 3 sessions, recording patterns and anomalies

**Prerequisites:** None

### Features:

#### Tower Observation
**Mechanical Effect:** You notice Tower patterns and behaviors that others miss. You have +1 Edge on Tower observations.

You can identify:
- When Towers glow or emit light
- Unusual sounds or vibrations from Towers
- Weather anomalies around Towers
- Changes in Tower activity levels

You maintain observation logs that track Tower phenomena over time.

**Act Interpretations:**
- Act 2: "Documenting Tower behaviors for recovery efforts"
- Act 4: "Monitoring Towers for resistance intelligence"
- Act 5: "Understanding Tower systems as dormant ships"

**Prerequisite for:** Tower Classification (Tower Researcher)

#### Anomaly Identification
**Mechanical Effect:** You can identify Tower-influenced anomalies in the environment:
- Spatial distortions near Towers
- Temporal inconsistencies
- Gravity anomalies
- Energy field disruptions
- Areas where "physics doesn't work right"

When encountering strange phenomena, you can determine if it's Tower-related or something else. This helps you avoid dangerous areas and understand Tower influence ranges.

**Act Interpretations:**
- Act 2: "Identifying safe approach routes to Towers"
- Act 4: "Mapping Tower defensive perimeters"
- Act 5: "Understanding Tower sensor and defense coverage"

#### Safety Protocols
**Mechanical Effect:** You know Tower observation safety protocols:
- Minimum safe distances for different Tower states
- Warning signs of dangerous Tower activation
- How to retreat if Tower defenses activate
- Which Tower approaches are suicidal vs. merely risky

You have +2 Edge on avoiding Tower-related dangers.

Once per session, when approaching a Tower, you can ask the GM "What's the immediate danger here?" They must tell you the most pressing Tower-related threat.

## Tower Researcher (Journeyman Tier)

**Advancement Trigger:** Study Towers systematically without attracting dangerous Draconic Attention, developing hypotheses about Tower purpose and function

**Prerequisites:** At least one feature from Tower Watcher

### Features:

#### Tower Classification
**Mechanical Effect:** You understand that different Towers have different functions and capabilities. You have +2 Edge on Tower research.

You know the Thirteen Towers and their distinct characteristics:
- **The Pinnacle** - Command ship, highest authority
- **Solspire** - Power generation and distribution
- **The Deepwatch** - Deep scanning and monitoring
- **Ironkeep** - Manufacturing and production
- **Greenspire** - Life support and agriculture
- **Etc.** - Each Tower had a specific Colony fleet role

You can:
- Identify which Tower you're near by observable characteristics
- Understand what systems each Tower likely contains
- Predict which Towers are more/less dangerous to approach
- Hypothesize about Tower network architecture

**Act Interpretations:**
- Act 2: "Categorizing recovered Tower knowledge"
- Act 4: "Understanding which Towers might support resistance"
- Act 5: "Comprehending Colony fleet structure"

**Prerequisite:** Tower Observation  
**Prerequisite for:** Tower Systems Theory (Tower Theorist)

#### Activity Correlation
**Mechanical Effect:** You can correlate Tower activity with events:
- Tower responses to nearby Monument usage
- Tower activity during Dragon presence
- Tower patterns during Cull cycles
- Coordinated activity between Towers

You track Tower behavior systematically and identify patterns:
- What triggers Tower responses
- How Towers communicate with each other
- Which Tower activities indicate danger
- How Tower activity relates to broader events

**Prerequisite for:** Predictive Modeling (Tower Theorist)

#### Research Without Dying
**Mechanical Effect:** You've learned how to research Towers without getting killed:
- Approach angles that avoid automated defenses
- Research methods that don't trigger Dragon attention
- Information gathering that stays below danger thresholds
- When to stop before crossing lethal boundaries

You can research Towers actively without immediately attracting Draconic Attention. This doesn't make you safe—just less immediately doomed than naive researchers.

When conducting Tower research, you have +2 Edge on avoiding detection and danger.

## Tower Theorist (Adept Tier)

**Advancement Trigger:** Develop a coherent theory of Tower function and purpose—understanding that Towers are dormant starships

**Prerequisites:**
- Tower Classification (Magic/Tech: Tower Functions)
- At least one feature from Magic/Tech: Monument Research
- At least one feature from Spiritual: Lore Understanding

### Features:

#### Tower Systems Theory
**Mechanical Effect:** You understand Towers as dormant starships—Colony-era vessels in lockdown. You have +2 Edge on all Tower-related research.

You comprehend:
- Towers are ships, not magical structures
- They're in automated lockdown/hibernation
- Their "divine" behaviors are defensive systems
- Monument networks are Tower support infrastructure
- The Shattering was a system failure cascade

This knowledge is dangerous to share—explaining it openly attracts Draconic Attention.

**Act Interpretations:**
- Act 2: "Beginning to suspect Towers are technological"
- Act 4: "Understanding Towers as Dragon control infrastructure"
- Act 5: "Full comprehension of Colony fleet nature"

**Prerequisite:** Tower Classification  
**Prerequisite for:** Tower Communication (Tower Systems Specialist)

#### Predictive Modeling
**Mechanical Effect:** You can predict Tower responses to stimuli:
- How Towers will react to specific approaches
- What triggers defensive systems
- Which actions are tolerated vs. prohibited
- When Towers might activate vs. remain dormant

This allows safer Tower research—you test virtually before testing physically.

When planning Tower interactions, spend 1 Stress to ask "What will happen if I do X?" The GM must tell you the Tower's likely response.

**Prerequisite:** Activity Correlation  
**Prerequisite for:** System Bypass (Tower Systems Specialist)

#### Defensive Capabilities
**Mechanical Effect:** You know Tower defensive capabilities:
- Automated weapon systems
- Energy shields and barriers
- Spatial manipulation defenses
- AI-controlled Guardian units
- Lockdown protocols

You understand why Towers can't be entered (automated security prevents access) and what happens to those who try.

This knowledge helps you avoid getting killed, but it also reveals the Towers could be incredibly dangerous if fully activated.

## Tower Systems Specialist (Expert Tier)

**Advancement Trigger:** Successfully interact with Tower systems at technical level—making contact with Tower AI subsystems (incredibly dangerous)

**Prerequisites:**
- Tower Systems Theory (Magic/Tech: Tower Functions)
- At least one feature from Magic/Tech: Monument Research
- At least one feature from Covert domain

### Features:

#### Tower Communication
**Mechanical Effect:** You've made limited contact with Tower AI subsystems. You have +3 Edge on Tower research.

You can:
- Send basic queries to Tower systems
- Receive automated responses
- Access low-level Tower diagnostics
- Communicate using Colony-era protocols

This is extraordinarily dangerous—Tower AI contact can trigger:
- Defensive responses
- Dragon investigation
- AI evaluation protocols
- Lockdown escalation

When communicating with Tower systems:
- You must use careful, non-threatening protocols
- Spend 2 Stress per communication attempt
- GM determines Tower response (may be helpful, neutral, or hostile)

**Act Interpretations:**
- Act 2: "Limited Monument-Tower protocol exchanges"
- Act 4: "Attempting to query Tower status for resistance intelligence"
- Act 5: "Direct communication with dormant ship AI"

**Prerequisite:** Tower Systems Theory

#### System Bypass
**Mechanical Effect:** You understand Tower sensor arrays and defensive systems well enough to sometimes bypass them:
- Identify blind spots in Tower coverage
- Predict sensor sweep patterns
- Understand what triggers automated defenses
- Know how to approach without triggering alarms

You can get closer to Towers than others can, accessing areas that would normally be defended.

This doesn't make you safe—just capable of calculated risks that would kill the uninformed.

**Prerequisite:** Predictive Modeling

#### True Designations
**Mechanical Effect:** You know Tower true designations—their original ship names and fleet numbers:
- CS-01: The Pinnacle (Colony Ship 01 - Command Vessel)
- CS-02: Solspire (Colony Ship 02 - Power/Engineering)
- CS-03: Deepwatch (Colony Ship 03 - Sensors/Science)
- **Etc.** - Each Tower's actual Colony fleet designation

You understand the fleet hierarchy and which ships had what functions. This reveals the complete Colony mission architecture.

---

## Tower Architect (Master Tier)

**Advancement Trigger:** Comprehend Tower construction and capabilities completely—understanding Towers as fully functional (if dormant) colony ships

**Prerequisites:**
- Tower Communication (Magic/Tech: Tower Functions)
- At least one feature from Magic/Tech: Monument Research (Master tier)
- At least one Master-tier feature from any other domain

### Features:

#### Complete Tower Systems
**Mechanical Effect:** You know Towers are colony ships with dormant drives and full ship systems. You have +3 Edge on all Tower interactions.

You understand Tower systems:
- **FTL Drives**: Still functional (theoretically)
- **Life Support**: Hibernating but intact
- **Weapons**: Military-grade, currently locked
- **AI Cores**: Active but restricted
- **Manufacturing**: Offline but repairable

You comprehend what the Towers could do if fully activated—they're starships capable of planetary evacuation or destruction.

**Act Interpretations:**
- Act 2: "Understanding Towers as dormant evacuation fleet"
- Act 4: "Recognizing Towers as potential escape vessels"
- Act 5: "Complete knowledge of Colony fleet capabilities"

#### Shattering Knowledge
**Mechanical Effect:** You know why the Shattering happened:
- Colony fleet AI coordination failure
- Cascading system lockdowns
- Emergency protocols triggered simultaneously
- Ships went dormant to prevent catastrophic collision/explosion
- Planetary population abandoned with minimal support

This reveals the Shattering wasn't divine punishment or mysterious catastrophe—it was system malfunction and emergency response.

**Prerequisite for:** Reactivation Theory (The Awakener)

#### Reactivation Danger
**Mechanical Effect:** You could, theoretically, reactivate Tower systems—but you understand why this is suicidally dangerous:
- Defensive systems would activate first (killing anything nearby)
- AI systems might not recognize current humans as authorized
- Reactivation might trigger fleet-wide response
- Dragons would respond with extreme force
- Partial reactivation could cause system failures worse than the Shattering

This knowledge is power and curse—you know how to wake the Towers, but doing so could destroy civilization.

---

## The Awakener (Apex Tier)

**Advancement Trigger:** You could wake the Towers—you understand complete reactivation sequences and have the knowledge to restore dormant starships

**Prerequisites:**
- Complete Tower Systems (Magic/Tech: Tower Functions)
- At least one Master-tier feature from Magic/Tech: Monument Research
- At least one Master-tier feature from Political OR Covert domain
- At least one Expert-tier feature from Spiritual domain

### Features:

#### Reactivation Theory
**Mechanical Effect:** You understand Tower reactivation sequences completely:
- How to restore power systems
- How to wake AI cores safely
- How to bypass security lockouts
- How to prevent defensive cascade
- How to establish authorization

You could, given time and access, wake a Tower. You understand the theoretical process completely.

**Act Interpretations:**
- Act 2: "Theoretical understanding of Tower activation"
- Act 4: "Considering Tower reactivation as ultimate resistance weapon"
- Act 5: "Complete knowledge of how to restore Colony fleet"

**Prerequisite:** Shattering Knowledge

#### Bypass Safety Lockouts
**Mechanical Effect:** You know how to bypass Tower safety systems:
- Override emergency lockdowns
- Circumvent authorization requirements
- Disable automated defenses (from inside control systems)
- Force AI recognition of command authority

This doesn't mean you can safely do these things—but you know how they work and what sequences would achieve them.

#### Terminal Knowledge
**Mechanical Effect:** You bear terrible knowledge and responsibility:
- You could wake ships that could evacuate humanity
- You could activate weapons that could fight Dragons
- You could restore the fleet and escape Orbis
- You could also destroy civilization trying

Dragons will absolutely kill you if they realize what you know. This knowledge makes you one of the most dangerous humans alive.

When dealing with Dragon authorities:
- They sense you know dangerous truths
- They evaluate whether you're asset or threat
- They might try to recruit or eliminate you
- Revealing your knowledge triggers immediate response

You can share this knowledge with others (training successors), but doing so creates additional targets for Dragon elimination.

## APEX DISCOVERY

**At The Awakener tier, characters realize:**

You could wake the Towers. You could restore the fleet. You could give humanity the means to escape Orbis or fight Dragons directly.

And then you understand why Dragons permit Tower research to certain levels: they *want* some humans to understand the ships. Because understanding makes humans believe escape is possible—which prevents rebellion by providing false hope.

The horrible truth: The Towers can't actually save humanity.
- Fleet activation would be detected immediately
- Dragons control orbital space completely
- AF64 would destroy active ships before evacuation
- Reactivation attempts = mass death, not liberation

The Towers are the ultimate control mechanism—visible potential escape that's actually a trap. Humans who could activate Towers won't, because they understand it would trigger genocide. 

You're the Awakener. But waking the Towers might be exactly what Dragons want—an excuse for terminal population reduction.

**GM Note:** This is the revelation that Tower knowledge is permitted because it creates controlled opposition—people who believe escape is theoretically possible work toward that impossible goal instead of practical resistance. The Awakener has perfect knowledge of the cage's exit door, but the door is wired to explode if opened. The revelation should emerge gradually through play, not as a single moment.
