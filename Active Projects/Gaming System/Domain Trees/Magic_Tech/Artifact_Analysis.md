# Artifact Analysis Tree
## Understanding Relics and Colony-Era Items

This tree represents your ability to identify, analyze, and understand pre-Shattering artifacts. Artifact Analysis specialists can distinguish Colony-era technology from later manufacture, determine artifact functions, and extract knowledge from physical objects. In a world where most "magic items" are misunderstood technology, those who can read artifacts hold keys to lost knowledge.

**Fictional Scale:** Relic Identifier → Artifact Scholar → Reverse Engineer

## APEX DISCOVERY

**At The Archive tier, characters realize:**

You understand Colony-era technology completely. You could guide humanity in rebuilding lost capabilities. You know how the ships were built, how artifacts function, how manufacturing worked.

And then you notice: technological knowledge persists *too* selectively. Certain artifacts survive while others vanish. Some technologies remain accessible while others are lost completely. You start to suspect artifact preservation patterns have been *managed*—that something vast has curated which technologies remain available.

The horrible question: Is artifact distribution accidental, or designed? Do Dragons permit certain technological recovery because it creates the illusion of progress while preventing actual independence? When you study artifacts, are you recovering lost knowledge—or are you just cataloging the tools you're permitted to have?

You're the Archive. But the archive itself might be a carefully managed collection.

**GM Note:** This is the realization that technological recovery might be controlled—that Dragons have permitted certain artifacts to survive and be discovered while ensuring truly dangerous technologies remain lost. The Archive has perfect knowledge of what exists, but that existence itself might be curated. The revelation should emerge gradually through play, not as a single moment.
