# Covert Domain - The Thirteen Towers
## PRIMARY FOCUS: Intelligence, Secrets, Information Warfare

---

## Domain Overview

**Core Question:** "What is known and what remains hidden?"

**Sphere of Influence:** Information gathering, secret networks, infiltration, counter-intelligence, and the manipulation of what people know and believe.

**What Covert Characters Shape:**
- What secrets are exposed and what stays buried
- Who has access to critical information
- How intelligence flows through power structures
- Which lies are believed and which truths are dismissed

---

## Covert Domain Philosophy

The Covert domain is the **heart of Thirteen Towers gameplay**. This is a spy thriller in fantasy clothing, and Covert specialists are the protagonists.

Intelligence work on Orbis scales from:
- **Novice**: Local informants, basic surveillance
- **Journeyman**: Professional spy networks, code-breaking
- **Adept**: Multi-city intelligence operations
- **Expert**: Realm-wide shadow organizations
- **Master**: Continental intelligence apparatus
- **Apex**: Information monopoly, rewriting narratives at scale

The Covert domain intersects with every other domain:
- **+ Martial:** Special operations, intelligence-driven warfare
- **+ Political:** Blackmail, leverage, kingmaking through secrets
- **+ Economic:** Industrial espionage, smuggling networks
- **+ Spiritual:** Infiltrating cults, manipulating beliefs
- **+ Magic/Tech:** Stealing Monument research, Tower intelligence

## Covert Domain Advancement Notes

**Typical Progression Pace:**
- Novice → Journeyman: 5-8 successful operations or investigations
- Journeyman → Adept: Build network or solve major case
- Adept → Expert: Establish realm-level presence
- Expert → Master: Become institutional (your work outlives individual operations)
- Master → Apex: Legendary status, continental impact

**Multi-Tree Development:**
Most successful Covert characters combine trees:
- Intelligence Networks + Infiltration = Classic Spymaster
- Investigation + Counter-Intelligence = Detective/Mole Hunter
- Intelligence Networks + Information Warfare = Propaganda Chief
- Infiltration + Investigation = Field Investigator
- All Five Trees = The Perfect Spy (rare, terrifying)

**Domain Crossover Opportunities:**
- Covert + Martial = Special Operations Commander
- Covert + Political = Kingmaker Through Blackmail
- Covert + Economic = Industrial Spy, Smuggling Network
- Covert + Spiritual = Cult Infiltrator, Belief Manipulator
- Covert + Magic/Tech = Monument Intelligence Specialist

**Why This is the Primary Domain:**

This is a **spy thriller**. Covert domain progression maps directly to the genre:
- Acts 1-2: Building networks, investigating local mysteries (Novice-Journeyman)
- Acts 3-4: Unraveling realm-level conspiracies (Adept-Expert)
- Act 5: Continental intelligence wars, truth vs lies (Master-Apex)

Covert mastery isn't just personal power—it's **information supremacy**, the most valuable commodity on Orbis.
