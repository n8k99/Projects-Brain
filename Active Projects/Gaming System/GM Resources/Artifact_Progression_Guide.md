# Artifact Progression Guide
## When Sci-Fi Elements Appear

## Episodes 1-30: NONE (Pure Medieval)
NO artifacts. Maintain 100% medieval fantasy. Magic, dragons, mysterious Towers only.

## Episodes 31-40: Ambiguous Objects
Players MIGHT suspect, but can't be certain:
- Smooth metal cylinders (power cells)
- Glowing stones that never dim (LEDs)
- "Wands" that warm wounds (medical scanners)

**Describe in medieval terms:** "blessed relics," "dragonforged items," "Tower-touched objects"

## Episodes 41-55: Recognizable to Players
Players recognize sci-fi elements, characters don't:
- Power packs, memory drives, utility belts
- Moving parts, buttons, seams
- Text/symbols that look manufactured

**NPCs still treat as magic.** Players experience dramatic irony.

## Episodes 56-70: Functional Technology
Still works after 10,000 years:
- Medical scanners that display diagnostics
- Communication devices
- Environmental suits
- Fabrication tools

**Players can use them.** Characters learn through trial and error, still frame as "ancient magic."

## Episodes 71-85: Context-Providing
Readable displays, intact weapons, partial databases:
- Screens showing English-like text
- Warning labels
- Operational manuals (fragmentary)
- Colony mission references

**This is when "ancient elven artifacts" become "colony equipment."**

## Episodes 86-100: Full Access
Working terminals, AF64 themselves, intact databases:
- Complete ship manifests
- Chronicle databases
- Monument control interfaces
- T.A.S.K.S. communication

**The full truth revealed.**

## Description Guidelines

### Always Through Medieval Lens First

❌ **Wrong:** "You find a portable medical scanner with biometric display."

✅ **Right:** "You find a smooth metal wand that hums faintly. When you hold it over a wound, the pain lessens and a small glowing panel shows strange symbols."

### Let Players Investigate

Don't tell them what it is. Let them:
- Experiment
- Show it to NPCs (who won't understand either)
- Compare to other artifacts
- Eventually realize the truth themselves

## Example Artifacts by Episode Range

### Episodes 31-40 (Ambiguous)
- "Eternal torch" (LED light stick)
- "Healing stone" (dermal regenerator)
- "Speaking crystal" (broken communicator that hums)
- "Weather charm" (atmospheric sensor)

### Episodes 41-55 (Recognizable)
- "Ancient soldier's pack" (tactical loadout)
- "Scribe's quill" (data stylus)
- "Far-sight glass" (optical scope)
- "Memory tablet" (data pad, screen cracked)

### Episodes 56-70 (Functional)
- Working medical scanner
- Intact comm device
- Environmental suit
- Fabricator (makes simple items)
- Power cell (charges other devices)

### Episodes 71-85 (Context-Providing)
- Terminal showing "COLONIZATION MISSION LOG"
- Weapon with English warning labels
- Medical bay with intact displays
- Map showing "LANDING ZONES"

### Episodes 86+ (Full Access)
- Complete ship databases
- AF64 communication terminals
- Monument network controls
- T.A.S.K.S. interfaces
- Intact cryobays

## GM Guidelines

1. **Track episode number** - Don't introduce artifacts too early
2. **Describe function, not name** - Let players figure out what it is
3. **NPC reactions** - Locals treat all as "magic" or "Tower-touched"
4. **Condition matters** - Older = more degraded, less obvious
5. **Player agency** - Let them experiment and discover
