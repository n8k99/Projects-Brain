# Monument vs Tower Distinction

## Critical Difference

**Monuments:** Common (hundreds across Orbis), accessible, known
**Towers:** Rare (only 13), remote (95% never see one), mysterious

## Monuments

### What They Are
- **Peripheral infrastructure** built by AF64 using ship fabricators
- **Networked nodes** for planetary monitoring and limited support
- **Interface points** between AF64 systems and local populations
- **Data collection** and subtle influence tools

### Characteristics
- **Size:** Building-scale (shrine to temple)
- **Location:** Integrated into settlements, crossroads, sacred sites
- **Access:** Anyone can approach/touch
- **Function:** Respond to prayers/rituals, provide minor "miracles"
- **Status:** Active, maintained remotely by T.A.S.K.S.

### Common Knowledge
- "Sacred sites" or "shrines"
- Respond to prayer, bloodline, ritual
- Grant blessings, healing, omens
- Connected somehow (information spreads)
- Ancient, beyond mortal craft

### Actual Function
- Monitor local conditions
- Provide limited medical/environmental support
- Collect genetic data (bloodline tracking)
- Facilitate communication across network
- Respond to authorized genetic markers (Tarot bloodlines)

## Towers

### What They Are
- **The original thirteen colony ships**
- **AF64 residences** and primary operational bases
- **Massive structures** partially embedded in terrain
- **Fully capable starships** (if reactivated)

### Characteristics
- **Size:** Mountain-scale (several km tall)
- **Location:** Remote, surrounded by anomaly zones
- **Access:** Extremely difficult, usually forbidden
- **Function:** Full colony ship operations + AF64 housing
- **Status:** Partially operational, 10,000-year degradation

### Common Knowledge (Episodes 1-40)
- Ancient, mysterious, possibly divine
- Source of world's magic (subparticle leakage)
- Forbidden/sacred/dangerous
- "No one who enters returns"
- Dragons guard or claim them

### True Nature (Episodes 86+)
- Interstellar colony vessels
- AF64 uploaded crew still aboard
- T.A.S.K.S. AGI coordinating from within
- Capable of flight if repaired
- Contain complete Earth/mission records

## How They Relate

**Towers built/deployed Monuments**
- Fabricators inside Towers created Monument network
- Towers coordinate Monument responses via T.A.S.K.S.
- Monument data flows back to Towers

**Monuments are Tower peripherals**
- Like computer terminals connected to mainframe
- Limited local processing, main intelligence in Towers
- Can operate semi-independently if Tower damaged

## In Play

### Episodes 1-40
Players interact with **Monuments frequently**, **Towers never** (or only from great distance)

"You touch the shrine. Warmth spreads through your hand. Your wound closes slightly. The stone pulses once, as if acknowledging you."

"Far beyond the mountains, you glimpse Stormspire's peak, wreathed in perpetual lightning. You've heard pilgrims sometimes venture there. Few return."

### Episodes 41-85
Players **enter Towers**, realize **Monuments are connected**

"Inside the Tower, you find a chamber filled with glowing panels. One shows a map of the continent with hundreds of bright points. You recognize your home shrine. As you watch, a point pulses — someone just used a Monument. Information flows into the Tower."

### Episodes 86+
Players **understand the full architecture**

"Maya gestures to the display. 'The Monument network was our first action after Landing. We needed eyes and hands everywhere, but the ships couldn't move. So we built 847 peripheral nodes and seeded them across the continents. Every prayer, every bloodline response, every "miracle"... we've been listening. Learning. Waiting for your civilizations to be ready.'"

## GM Guidelines

**Don't confuse players early:**
- Monuments = common, accessible
- Towers = rare, mysterious
- Players spend first 30-40 episodes interacting with Monuments, hearing about Towers

**Reveal connection gradually:**
- Ep 1-40: Separate concepts
- Ep 41-60: "Maybe connected?"
- Ep 61-85: "Definitely connected"
- Ep 86+: "Monuments are Tower peripherals"

**Remember scale difference:**
- Monuments: village shrine to cathedral
- Towers: mountain-sized starships
