# 🐉 Dracons
Dragons are not abstract beasts. They are:
- **Mentors**
- **Tyrants**
- **Divine figures**
- **Espionage sponsors**
- **Regional forces of weather, fertility, or fear**
They are tied to the Towers — some guard them, others want them reactivated. They often **guide local humanoid evolution**, manipulate civilizations, or treat cities as apprentices or rivals.
- **[[active/Gaming System/Dragons/03 Metallic Guardians/Metallic Guardians]]** are protective but aloof.
- **[[active/Gaming System/Dragons/02 Chromatic Alliances/ChromaticAlliances|Chromatics]] (Dominators)** often serve as enemies, tyrants, or hidden rulers.
- **[[DragonCults|Dragon cults]]** spread in secret — some out of worship, others through deals for power.
