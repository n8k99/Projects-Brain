    and aware of it must succeed on a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw or become [frightened](rules/conditions.mdfrightened)
    for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its
    turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw
    is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the dragon's
    Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.
- name: Breath Weapons (Recharge 5-6).
  desc: 'The dragon uses one of the following breath weapons: - **Fire Breath.** The
    dragon exhales fire in a 90-foot line that is 10 feet wide. Each creature in that
    line must make a DC 21 Dexterity saving throw, taking 56 (`16d6`) fire damage
    on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.   - **Sleep Breath.**
    The dragon exhales sleep gas in a 90-foot cone. Each creature in that area must
    succeed on a DC 21 Constitution saving throw or fall [unconscious](rules/conditions.mdunconscious)
    for 10 minutes. This effect ends for a creature if the creature takes damage or
    someone uses an action to wake it.'
- name: Change Shape.
  desc: The dragon magically polymorphs into a humanoid or beast that has a challenge
    rating no higher than its own, or back into its true form. It reverts to its true
    form if it dies. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying is absorbed or borne
    by the new form (the dragon's choice). In a new form, the dragon retains its alignment,
    hit points, Hit Dice, ability to speak, proficiencies, Legendary Resistance, lair
    actions, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores, as well as this action.
    Its statistics and capabilities are otherwise replaced by those of the new form,
    except any class features or legendary actions of that form.

    succeed on a DC 22 Dexterity saving throw or take 15 (`2d6 + 8`) bludgeoning damage
    and be knocked [prone](rules/conditions.mdprone). The dragon can then fly up to
    half its flying speed.
