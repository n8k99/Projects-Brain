    and aware of it must succeed on a DC 20 Wisdom saving throw or become [frightened](rules/conditions.mdfrightened)
    for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its
    turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw

    Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.

    damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.   - **Repulsion
    Breath.** The dragon exhales repulsion energy in a 30-foot cone. Each creature
    in that area must succeed on a DC 23 Strength saving throw. On a failed save,
    the creature is pushed 60 feet away from the dragon.
- name: Change Shape.
  desc: The dragon magically polymorphs into a humanoid or beast that has a challenge
    rating no higher than its own, or back into its true form. It reverts to its true
    form if it dies. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying is absorbed or borne
    by the new form (the dragon's choice). In a new form, the dragon retains its alignment,
    hit points, Hit Dice, ability to speak, proficiencies, Legendary Resistance, lair
    actions, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores, as well as this action.

    half its flying speed.
