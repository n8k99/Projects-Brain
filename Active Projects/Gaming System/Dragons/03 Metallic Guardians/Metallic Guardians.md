# Metallic Alliances

The **Metallic Guardians** of Orbis embody the complex relationship between dragons and mortal civilizations. These dragons, known for their wisdom and restraint, dedicate themselves to the preservation of peace, justice, and balance. Unlike their chromatic counterparts, metallic dragons such as [[active/Gaming System/Dragons/03 Metallic Guardians/Gold Dragon|gold]], [[active/Gaming System/Dragons/03 Metallic Guardians/Silver Dragon|silver]], [[active/Gaming System/Dragons/03 Metallic Guardians/Brass Dragon|brass]], [[active/Gaming System/Dragons/03 Metallic Guardians/Bronze Dragon|bronze]], and [[active/Gaming System/Dragons/03 Metallic Guardians/Copper Dragon|copper]] are often viewed as noble protectors rather than conquerors or destroyers. However, even among metallic dragons, there is significant variation in how they interpret their roles as guardians—some act as benevolent rulers, while others remain distant overseers who only intervene in times of great need.

Metallic dragons are not without their flaws; pride, ambition, and differing philosophies often lead to conflicts among their kind. Some believe that direct intervention is necessary to guide mortal societies, while others fear that excessive influence will lead to dependency or unintended destruction. There are also those who, after witnessing the cyclical failures of mortal civilizations, become disillusioned and risk becoming draconic tyrants themselves. They also tend to be the counterbalance on the [[Council of Ancients]] which protects the [[Sovereign Realms of Orbis]] from perpetual crisis. 

## **Ideals And Purpose of Metallic Guardians**

Metallic dragons see themselves as protectors and stewards, though the extent and methods of their protection vary widely. Their roles as guardians are shaped by their personal philosophies, experiences, and interactions with mortals.

## **Guardianship Philosophy**:

How metallic dragons interpret their roles as protectors of Orbis

### **Noble Stewardship**:

Some metallic dragons view themselves as noble stewards of the world, sworn to protect civilizations from threats such as planar incursions, draconic warlords, and rogue spellcasters. These dragons often forge long-lasting alliances with kingdoms and city-states, offering their wisdom and power in exchange for loyalty and respect.

### **Celestial Watchers**:

Others adopt a more distant approach, believing that mortals must grow and thrive on their own without direct interference. These dragons may observe the world from afar, only descending from their mountain or skyward lairs when they sense an existential threat.

### **Catalysts Of Change**:

A minority of metallic dragons believe that true protection comes from empowering mortals to become their own defenders. These dragons may teach mortals ancient draconic rites, grant boons, or even orchestrate challenges to help civilizations grow stronger.

### **Philosophical Conflict**:

Disagreements over guardianship often lead to rivalries between metallic dragons. For example, a silver dragon who believes in direct intervention may clash with a bronze dragon who prefers subtlety and indirect guidance.

## **Types Of Guardianship**:

### **Oathbound Guardians**:

These dragons swear oaths to protect specific locations, rulers, or sacred sites. Some Oathbound Guardians act as advisors to royal courts, while others slumber beneath ancient ruins, bound to rise only when the land is threatened.

- **Example**: **[[DrakReaeth the Coastal]]** (Bronze Dragon) guards the coastal ruins of an ancient city believed to house a planar seal. He has not left [[DrakReaeth the CoastalLair|his lair]] in centuries, bound by his oath to guard the site until the stars align again.

### **Wandering Wardens**:

Nomadic metallic dragons who roam the skies, rivers, and plains of [[Orbis]], intervening in conflicts where they sense injustice or imbalance. These dragons rarely stay in one place for long, earning both reverence and suspicion from mortals.

- **Example**: **[[VelThretus Brassheart]]** flies across the Emberway trade routes, where he amuses travelers with riddles and stories before driving off bandits and would-be assassins.

### **Cosmic Custodians**:

Ancient dragons entrusted with the safeguarding of cosmic nexuses and planar rifts. These guardians often possess knowledge of celestial phenomena, binding rituals, and extraplanar threats.

- **Example**: **Aelysira the Starborne** (Gold Dragon) resides near the **Astral Riftspire**, a monolithic structure connected to the Plane of Stars. She watches over it to prevent incursions from starborn entities and astral horrors.
