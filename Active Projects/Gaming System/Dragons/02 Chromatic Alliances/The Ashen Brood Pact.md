# **The Ashen Brood Pact**
```ad-attention
#### **Description**:
A coalition of fire-breathing red and brass-tainted black dragons led by the infamous **[[IgnarathTheScorchedTyrant]]**.
The pact formed prior to the **[[War of Ash and Iron]]**, an apocalyptic conflict that nearly consumed the volcanic Emberspine Peaks.
#### **Goal**:
To claim the forges and treasure vaults of the **[[ZhulmarDominion]]** and convert them into draconic lairs. The Ashen Brood sought to drown the dwarven citadels in rivers of molten lava.
#### **Outcome**:
The pact was believed to have been broken by an internal betrayal—historical records claimed the ancient black dragon **[[Vorynth the Emberthief]]** stole a prized draconic relic from Ignarath. The ensuing chaos allowed the dwarves to strike a decisive blow that drove the remaining dragons into retreat. However, the truth is far darker.
#### **Legacy**:
The ruins of several mountain fortresses still bear the scorch marks of the Ashen Brood's assault, and whispers of Ignarath's return persist in draconic circles. The [[War of Ash and Iron]] stands as the formative event which created the [[ZhulmarDominion]].

## Historical Evolution

### War of Ash and Iron (GC+899)

The original Ashen Brood Pact was a formidable alliance of red and black dragons under the leadership of Ignarath. Their campaign against the dwarven mountain kingdoms, while ultimately unsuccessful, laid the groundwork for the eventual unification of these realms into the Zhulmar Dominion.

### Resurgence as the Ashborn Brood (GC+1129)

Approximately 230 years after their initial defeat, a new generation of flame-drakes—predominantly red dragons this time—reconstituted the alliance under the name **Ashborn Brood**. Unlike their predecessors, this iteration incorporated dangerous planar magic, creating rifts to the [[Aerys|Elemental Plane of Fire]] to enhance their power.
Approximately 230 years after their initial defeat, a new generation of flame-drakes—exclusively red dragons this time—reconstituted the alliance under the name **[[active/Gaming System/Dragons/02 Chromatic Alliances/The Ashen Brood Pact|Ashborn Brood]]**. Unlike their predecessors, this iteration incorporated dangerous planar magic, creating rifts to the Elemental Plane of Fire to enhance their power and potentially resurrect or channel the power of Ignarath himself.

Key differences from the original pact:
- Complete absence of black dragons, who were not invited to join the new pact
- Integration of elemental magic and planar rifts to [[Aerys|Elemental Plane of Fire]]
- More sophisticated tactics targeting both the [[Zhulmar Dominion]] and [[Protectorate Of The Celanthadri]]
- A hidden secondary objective to systematically eradicate black dragons from Orbis

The Ashborn Invasion was not merely a military campaign but a planar incursion, with elemental forces of fire and ash merging with draconic power. This catastrophic event was ultimately repelled through the combined efforts of:
- Dwarven forge-priests activating the ancient **Molten Veil** ward at Ironpeak Citadel
- The [[Government Types/FactionsandPolitics/Circle of Thorns]] and [[Government Types/FactionsandPolitics/Verdant Sentinels]] creating the **[[Verdant Shroud]]** to protect the forests
- A years-long campaign to seal dozens of planar rifts that had opened during the invasion
### The Truth About Vorynth

What few in [[Orbis]] know is that Vorynth the Emberthief never betrayed the original pact. As an Ancient Black Dragon who sat on the Council of Ancients, Vorynth traveled to Ignarath's familial estate on the [[Aerys|Elemental Plane of Fire]] to inform him that he and his lineage would not be joining the Red Lineage in their attempt to resurrect Ignarath through planar magic. Vorynth, believing black dragons to be the truest form of dragonkind, considered Ignarath unworthy of his assistance a second time.

Vorynth never returned from Aerys. To this day, he remains captive in a deep, scorching cavern beneath Ignarath's ancestral holdings—a fact known only to the highest echelons of the red dragon hierarchy.

This explains why the Ashborn Invasion was less successful than anticipated. The red dragons divided their resources between their assault on the Zhulmar Dominion and Protectorate territories and a swift, methodical purge of black dragons from Orbis—a grim precursor to the fate that would later befall the gold dragons during the Red Surge. 

### Influence on the Red Surge

Some scholars believe remnants of the Ashborn Brood may have played a role in orchestrating the Red Surge that began with the Night of Molten Tears. While direct evidence remains scarce, draconic manipulation is suspected in testing Orbis's defenses through the Ashborn Invasion before launching this later, more sophisticated assault.

## Legacy Items

Several artifacts from both incarnations of the Brood remain scattered across Orbis:

- **Ashborn-scaled weapons**: Forged with scales from fallen Ashborn dragons, these weapons retain heat and can ignite when wielded with sufficient passion
- **Emberscarred rune-stones**: Created during the planar incursion, these stones contain trapped elemental energy and are prized by both researchers and those seeking to harness their power
- **Ignarath's Tear**: A legendary gem said to have been created from the solidified rage of Ignarath after Vorynth's defiance, rumored to grant its bearer visions of weak points in any structure
- **Vorynth's Scales**: Extremely rare black dragon scales with unusual red veining, sometimes found in the possession of high-ranking red dragon cultists. These scales are believed to have been harvested from Vorynth himself during his ongoing captivity. It is rumored that the leader of the Emberborn Circle wears a suit of [[black-dragon-scale-mail|Black Dragon Scale Mail]] made from this hoard of scales. If these rumors are true, then it is well-known that [[Thordak Bravone]], is the master smith who crafted it and formed all its secrets. 

## Dwarven Collaborators

While the [[Zhulmar Dominion]] as a whole fought fiercely against both incarnations of the Ashen Brood, certain dwarven factions aligned themselves with the dragons, either willingly or through coercion.

### The Emberborn Circle

The most significant draconic cult with dwarven membership is the **Emberborn Circle**, dedicated to Ignarath. This fanatic organization believes that destruction through fire purifies the soul and prepares the world for rebirth. What makes the cult particularly dangerous is the presence of masterful dwarven forge-priests who brought their knowledge of metallurgy and runecraft to serve draconic purposes.

During the Ashborn Invasion, certain members of prominent dwarven families secretly provided intelligence on Zhulmar defenses and forge techniques to the Ashborn Brood. Some historians suspect that the activation of the Molten Veil ward at Ironpeak Citadel would not have been necessary had these betrayals not compromised outer defensive positions.

### House Bravone Schism

The ancient and respected **House of Bravone**—renowned for their forge-mastery and predating even the Crown Mines—experienced a significant schism during the Ashen Brood conflicts. While most Bravones remained loyal to the Dominion, a faction led by Forge-Elder Thordak Bravone became entranced by the draconic promises of superior flame manipulation techniques.

These renegade Bravones established hidden sanctuaries near the **Emberfall Scar**, where they conducted experimental metallurgy using dragon fire. Their creations—especially the dreaded **Emberbrand Weapons**—became sought-after tools of assassination throughout the post-war period, capable of inflicting wounds that continued to burn from within.

Modern Bravones consider this chapter of their history a grave dishonor, and many undergo a ritual called the "Ember Trial" to prove their loyalty to the Dominion rather than to ancestral ties. This is particularly true for the direct bloodline descended from Thordak's nephew, High Forgemaster Durnek Bravone, whose own son Korrallan eventually left the forge altogether—in part due to the suffocating atmosphere of rigid tradition and loyalty tests that arose in response to Thordak's betrayal.
