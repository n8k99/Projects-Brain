## Common Questions

### "Which Archetype Should I play?"
Read [[active/Gaming System/Player Resources/Archetype_Quick_Reference]] and pick the one whose values and approach resonate with you. Any Archetype can pursue any Domain.

### "How Do I Get Better at things?"
See [[active/Gaming System/Player Resources/Domain_Trees_Player_Guide#How Advancement Works]]. You advance through story triggers, not XP. Pursue NPC relationships and make meaningful choices.

### "What Should My Primary Domain be?"
Choose what interests you! The game emphasizes **Covert** (investigation/intelligence) over combat, but any Domain can be effective.

### "How Does Edge work?"
See [[active/Gaming System/Player Resources/Quick_Reference#Edge (Modifiers)]]. Edge is ONE number (-5 to +5) combining all advantages and disadvantages. Discuss the situation and agree on the number.

### "When Do I roll?"
Only when the outcome is uncertain, failure has consequences, and success matters. See [[active/Gaming System/Player Resources/Quick_Reference#When to Roll]].

### "What If I want to Do Something not Covered by My Trees?"
You can attempt anything your character reasonably could do! Trees give you Edge and permissions, but don't restrict your actions.

## Tips for Players

### During Character Creation
1. Choose concepts that interest you, not what seems "optimal"
2. Think about relationships and connections - they drive advancement
3. Give your character clear goals and principles
4. Work with other players to create complementary characters

### During Play
1. Describe what you're doing in the fiction first, then roll
2. Ask about Position and Effect before rolling
3. Look for ways to get Edge through clever approaches
4. Use your competencies and Tree nodes - don't forget them!
5. Pursue NPC relationships to unlock advancement
6. Make meaningful choices aligned with your character's values

### When Advancing
1. Ask the GM: "What would I need to do to unlock this node?"
2. Pursue relationships with NPCs who can teach you
3. Make choices that align with the Domain you want to develop
4. Remember: advancement is fictional, not mechanical

## Feedback

If you find something unclear or missing, discuss with your GM. This system emphasizes **fiction first** and **table consensus**, so when in doubt, talk it through!

**Core Principle**: If the rules don't cover it, describe what you want to do in the fiction and work with the GM to determine Difficulty, Position, Effect, and Edge.
