## Essential Rules for Players

## Core Roll Mechanic

When taking a risky action:

> **1d20 + Stat Mod + Edge vs Difficulty**

### Difficulty Bands
- **8** - Trivial (mostly succeeds)
- **12** - Standard (real risk)
- **16** - Hard (needs skill/leverage)
- **20+** - Extreme (requires setup/tools/magic)

### Outcomes
- **Success** (beat Difficulty) - You get what you wanted
- **Partial** (exactly meet Difficulty) - You succeed with complication
- **Failure** (below Difficulty) - You don't achieve the goal

- **Standard** - Normal success, expected result
- **Great** - Major success, significant change

## The Six Domains

Where you develop expertise and influence:

### ⚔️ Martial
Physical force, warfare, command
- *You shape*: Battles, defenses, military power

### 🕵️ Covert (PRIMARY FOCUS)
Information, secrets, intelligence
- *You shape*: What's known/hidden, who's exposed

### 🧪 Magic/Tech
Monuments, relics, anomalies
- *You shape*: How strange powers function

### ✨ Spiritual
Belief, faith, rituals
- *You shape*: What people believe and why

### 💰 Economic
Trade, resources, logistics
- *You shape*: Who has resources, where value flows

### 🏛️ Political
Authority, legitimacy, governance

---

## Advancement

**You advance through story, not XP**

### Advancement Triggers (Examples)
- Form NPC relationships (mentors, contacts)
- Make meaningful choices
- Complete story milestones
- Build institutional ties
- Discover knowledge through investigation

**You unlock nodes in Domain Trees** by completing fictional triggers, not by grinding combat.

---

## Combat Quick Reference

### Battle Order System
Initiative determines when you act (see Core Rules 05)

### Standard Actions
- **Attack**: Roll vs target's Defense
- **Move**: Engage/disengage, reposition
- **Help**: Grant +1 Edge to ally's next action
- **Defend**: +2 to your Defense until your next turn
- **Special Action**: Use Tree node ability

### Harm Track
- **Level 1**: -1 to rolls, minor wound
- **Level 2**: -2 to rolls, serious wound
- **Level 3**: -3 to rolls, critical wound
- **Level 4**: Incapacitated, requires help

---

## Key Concepts

### When to Roll
Only roll when:
1. Outcome is uncertain
2. Failure has consequences
3. Success matters

### Fiction First
The story determines what's possible, then you translate to mechanics.

### Moral Profile
Acting against your principles triggers **Moral Friction** (increased Difficulty).

### Competencies
What you know and can do:
- **Novice** (1 point): Basic familiarity
- **Trained** (2 points): Solid competence
- **Expert** (3 points): Deep skill

---

## At the Table

### Player Questions to Ask
1. "What's the Difficulty?"
2. "What's my Position and Effect?"
3. "Can I get Edge from my background/archetype/situation?"
4. "What happens if I fail?"

### GM Always Answers
- What the Difficulty is
- What Position you're in
- What Effect you'll achieve on success
- What the risks are on failure

---

## Common Situations

### Group Challenges
- **Everyone rolls** if everyone's skill matters
- **Leader rolls with Edge** if one person directs
- **Best roller with disadvantage** if coordination is tricky

### Helping Others
Grant +1 Edge by assisting (describe how you help)

### Opposed Tests
Roll against target's Defense (10 + Stat Mod + Edge)

---

## Remember

1. **One roll resolves the whole action** - no extended checks
2. **Fiction first, math second** - story determines mechanics
3. **Expertise matters** - high stats + good Edge = reliable success
4. **Investigation > Combat** - this system emphasizes intelligence gathering
5. **Keep Edge simple** - one number, not a calculation puzzle
