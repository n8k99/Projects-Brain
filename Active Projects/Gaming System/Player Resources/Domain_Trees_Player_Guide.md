## How Advancement Works

### No XP Grinding

You don't "kill monsters for XP." You advance through **Advancement Triggers** - story events that unlock new abilities.

**Example Triggers:**
- "Gain the trust of three regional spymasters" (Covert)
- "Negotiate a treaty between hostile factions" (Political)
- "Decode a complete Chronicle fragment" (Magic/Tech)
- "Lead a ritual witnessed by 100+ believers" (Spiritual)
- "Establish a cross-realm supply route" (Economic)
- "Win recognition from a legendary warrior" (Martial)

### Node Tiers

Each Tree has nodes progressing through tiers:

**Novice** → **Journeyman** → **Adept** → **Expert** → **Master** → **Apex**

You start at Novice and work your way up through story progression.

---

## Building Your Character

### Starting Out
1. Choose a **Primary Domain** (where you'll focus most)
2. Select a starting node from one Tree in that Domain
3. Play the game and pursue relationships in that sphere

### As You Progress
Most characters develop:
- **One Primary Tree** (6-8 nodes, deep expertise)
- **2-3 Secondary Trees** (2-4 nodes each, complementary skills)
- **Occasional Dips** (1-2 nodes in useful areas)

**Example Investigation Character:**
- Covert/Intelligence Networks: 7 nodes (Novice → Master)
- Political/Diplomacy: 4 nodes (Novice → Expert)
- Spiritual/Lore Understanding: 3 nodes (Novice → Adept)
- Magic-Tech/Monument Research: 2 nodes (Novice → Journeyman)

---

## What Trees Give You

### Edge Bonuses
Nodes provide +1 to +3 Edge in specific situations

**Example**: "Regional Factor" gives +2 Edge when negotiating trade in your known region

### New Permissions
Nodes let you do things you couldn't before

**Example**: "Ghost Protocol" lets you establish deep cover identities that can withstand scrutiny

### Resources & Contacts
Nodes give you access to NPCs, locations, and assets

**Example**: "Network Handler" gives you 3-5 reliable informants in a city

---

## Domain Priorities

**This game emphasizes investigation over combat.**

Typical development distribution:
- **Covert**: 30-40% (PRIMARY)
- **Political**: 25-30%
- **Spiritual**: 20-25%
- **Magic/Tech**: 15-20%
- **Economic**: 10-15%
- **Martial**: 5-10% (minimal but functional)

**You can develop any domain** - these are guidelines, not restrictions.

---

## Archetypes vs Domains

**Important**: Your Archetype (Shieldbearer, Songbearer, etc.) is NOT a class restriction.

- Archetypes are **ethical frameworks** - how you approach problems morally
- **Any Archetype can develop any Domain Tree**
- A Songbearer can become a master spy
- A Shieldbearer can become an economic factor
- Your Archetype colors HOW you use domains, not WHICH domains you access

---

## Tips for Players

### Choose Domains That Interest You
Don't feel pressured to "optimize" - play what sounds fun and fits your character concept.

### Pursue NPC Relationships
Most advancement triggers involve NPCs. Make friends, find mentors, build networks.

### Make Meaningful Choices
Advancement happens when you commit to a path, not when you try to keep all options open.

### Ask About Triggers
If you want to advance in a Tree, ask the GM: "What would I need to do to unlock the next node?"

### Use Your Nodes
Don't forget your abilities! Your Tree nodes give you Edge and permissions - use them.

### Mix and Match
You're not locked into one domain. Develop complementary skills across multiple Trees.
