## Descriptive Tags with Mechanical Weight

---

## What Are Tags?

**Tags** are short descriptive phrases that:
- Describe fiction-first qualities of people, places, equipment, or situations
- Grant Edge bonuses when relevant
- Create fictional permissions (what you can do)
- Shape Position and Effect

**Core Principle**: Tags make description mechanically relevant.

---

## How Tags Work

### Edge from Tags

When a tag is relevant to your action:
- **Minor relevance**: +1 Edge
- **Major relevance**: +2 Edge

**Example**:
- You have "Master Swordsman" tag
- You're fighting with a sword → **+2 Edge** (major relevance)
- You're teaching sword techniques → **+1 Edge** (minor relevance)
- You're negotiating trade deals → **+0 Edge** (not relevant)

### Fictional Permission

Some tags grant permission to attempt actions that would otherwise be impossible:

- **"Tower Scholar"** → You can decipher Chronicle fragments (others can't)
- **"Dragontongue Speaker"** → You can read ancient inscriptions
- **"Monument Attuned"** → You sense Monument activation states

## Creating Custom Tags

### Guidelines for GMs

Good tags are:
1. **Evocative**: "Scarred Veteran" not "Combat Trained"
2. **Specific**: "Tower Scholar" not "Smart"
3. **Fiction-First**: "Giant-Blooded" not "+2 Strength"
4. **Situational**: Tags apply when relevant, not always

### Tag Balance

**+1 Edge tags**: Apply in specific but reasonably common situations
**+2 Edge tags**: Apply in narrow, specialized situations OR are rare/expensive

**Negative tags**: Should come with compensating benefits (lower cost, story hooks, unique permissions)

---

## Tag Stacking Rules

### Maximum Stack: +5 Edge Total

Even with many tags, you can't exceed +5 total Edge bonus.

**Example**:
- You're a **Master Duelist** (+2 in single combat)
- Using an **Exceptional Rapier** (+1 Edge)
- Fighting in **Formal Duel Context** (+1 Edge)
- You have **Higher Ground** (+1 Edge)

**Total**: +5 Edge (this is the maximum)

**Domain Trees** describe what you can become.

**Example**:

- **Tree Node**: "Weapon Specialist - Bows" (+2 Edge with bows)

They stack (to max +5 Edge total).
