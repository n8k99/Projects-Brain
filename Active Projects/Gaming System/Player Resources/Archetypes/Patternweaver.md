# Patternweaver
## The Analyst

---

> *"Everything has a pattern. Find the pattern, understand the system, control the outcome."*

---

## Core Philosophy

The Patternweaver's power lies in **systematic understanding**. You see connections others miss, identify underlying structures, and solve problems through **analysis rather than force**.

This isn't about raw intelligence—it's about **pattern recognition** and **methodical thinking**.

### What Drives a Patternweaver?

**Systems Thinking**: Everything is connected
- Actions have predictable consequences
- Complex problems have underlying logic
- Understanding the system lets you manipulate outcomes

**Evidence Over Assumption**: Truth comes from data
- Gather information before deciding
- Test hypotheses systematically
- Never assume when you can verify

**Preparation as Power**: Knowledge enables action
- Plan before acting
- Understand before intervening
- Informed decisions beat impulsive ones

---

## When You Get Edge

Patternweavers gain **+1 to +2 Edge** when:

### Analysis & Preparation
- **Acting on gathered intelligence** you've systematically collected
- **Exploiting patterns** you've identified in systems or behavior
- **Following plans** based on thorough analysis
- **Solving problems** through systematic understanding

### Pattern Recognition
- **Identifying connections** others missed
- **Predicting outcomes** based on observed patterns
- **Exploiting system weaknesses** you've analyzed
- **Spotting anomalies** that break expected patterns

### Methodical Approach
- **Operating with complete information**
- **Testing hypotheses** systematically
- **Executing multi-step plans** you've designed
- **Reverse-engineering systems** through observation

## Roleplaying a Patternweaver

### Key Questions for Your Character

**1. What pattern are you trying to understand?**
- Monument/Tower systems (technology)
- Political power structures (governance)
- Economic flows (resources)
- Reality itself (metaphysics)

**2. When did analysis fail you?**
- Incomplete information led you wrong
- Intuitive leap was correct, analysis wasn't
- Paralysis by analysis cost you something
- Pattern you saw wasn't there

**3. What's more important—understanding or action?**
- Understanding first, always (analysis paralysis risk)
- Action when understanding sufficient (pragmatic)
- Balance both (ideal but difficult)
- Sometimes act without full understanding (growth)

**4. Who taught you to think this way?**
- Mentor (systematic training)
- Trauma (chaos hurt you, order protects)
- Natural inclination (how your mind works)
- Necessity (survival required understanding)

---

## Patternweaver Dilemmas

### Analysis Paralysis

**The Problem**: You keep gathering data, unwilling to act without complete understanding.

But complete understanding is **impossible**. At some point, you must act.

**When do you decide you know enough?**

**Moral Friction**: Depends on principles
- "Complete information always" → +4 to act early
- "Sufficient information" → no friction
- "Perfect understanding" → paralysis (character flaw)

### The Intuitive Leap

**The Problem**: Someone makes an intuitive leap that contradicts your analysis—and they're **right**.

How do you handle being **wrong**?

**Growth Moment**: Recognizing that **intuition has value**, analysis isn't everything.

### The Pattern That Isn't There

**The Problem**: You see a pattern, act on it—and it was **random chance**, not system.

**Patternweavers assume pattern**. When there isn't one, they fail.

**Learning**: Sometimes things **are** random. Not everything is system.

### The Human Element

**The Problem**: You've analyzed the system perfectly, but **people aren't acting rationally**.

Humans are **irrational**. Your perfect analysis assumes logical actors.

**What do you do when the pattern should work, but people won't follow it?**

---

## Patternweaver Philosophy

### Everything Is System

**Core Belief**: Chaos is just **unidentified pattern**.

Given enough data and analysis:
- Complex problems become solvable
- Seemingly random events reveal structure
- Systems can be understood and controlled

**This is both power and limitation**—assumes everything IS pattern.

### Understanding Enables Control

**Knowledge Is Power**: Understand the system → manipulate the system.

Patternweavers seek control through **understanding**:
- Can't control what you don't understand
- Complete understanding enables precise intervention
- Ignorance is vulnerability

### The Map Is Not the Territory

**Advanced Understanding**: Your analysis is **model**, not **reality**.

High-tier Patternweavers learn:
- Models are useful but incomplete
- Abstraction loses information
- Sometimes you need to engage with messy reality, not clean models

## Patternweaver and Draconic Attention

**Low Risk**: General pattern recognition and analysis

**Moderate Risk** (+2-4):
- Analyzing Monument systems deeply
- Pattern recognition that reveals Colony technology truth
- Mapping Dragon decision-making patterns

**High Risk** (+6-8):
- Understanding Dragons as AIs (pattern reveals programming)
- Analyzing Tower systems (forbidden knowledge)
- Predicting Dragon interventions (they notice being analyzed)

**Patternweaver Advantage**: You can **predict when analysis will attract attention**—and stop before threshold.

**Patternweaver Temptation**: But the pattern is **so close** to complete understanding...
