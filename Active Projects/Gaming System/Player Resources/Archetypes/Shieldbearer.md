# Shieldbearer
## The Protector

---

> *"I stand between the blade and the innocent. That is all the purpose I need."*

---

## Core Philosophy

The Shieldbearer's identity is defined by a simple, powerful truth: **You interpose yourself between danger and those who cannot protect themselves.**

This is not about combat prowess (though many Shieldbearers develop it). This is about **ethical positioning**—the willingness to pay the cost that others shouldn't have to.

### What Drives a Shieldbearer?

**Protection as Identity**: You define yourself through what you defend
- Your ward's safety is more important than your own
- Abandoning your post is worse than death
- Being the wall others shelter behind gives your life meaning

**Physical Courage**: You don't flee when others would
- Fear is acceptable; fleeing is not
- Your body is a tool to shield others
- Pain is temporary; abandoning the innocent is permanent

**Sacrifice as Virtue**: Taking the hit is the right choice
- You bear burdens others shouldn't carry
- Your suffering prevents greater suffering
- Glory and recognition are secondary to duty fulfilled

---

## When You Get Edge

Shieldbearers gain **+1 to +2 Edge** when:

### Direct Protection
- **Interposing** between attacker and ally
- **Taking damage** meant for someone else
- **Holding a defensive position** against superior force
- **Shielding the vulnerable** from harm

### Defensive Positioning
- **Standing your ground** when others flee
- **Covering a retreat** for allies
- **Blocking a passage** to prevent enemy advance
- **Drawing fire** to protect others

### Sacrifice Actions
- **Accepting harm** to prevent greater harm
- **Staying behind** so others can escape
- **Absorbing consequences** meant for your ward
- **Enduring pain** to keep your post

---

### Personal Principles (Weight 1)

**Significant Compromise (+4 Difficulty)**:

## Shieldbearer Dilemmas

The best Shieldbearer stories come from impossible choices:

### The Trolley Problem
Two groups need protection. You can only save one. **Who do you choose?**

Moral Friction: Significant Compromise (+4) regardless of choice—you're abandoning someone you should protect.

### The Sacrifice Question
Protecting your ward requires your death. **Do you hesitate?**

True Shieldbearers don't—but the hesitation is human. Exploring that moment is powerful roleplay.

### The Worthy Ward Problem
Your ward is **guilty** (tyrant, criminal, abuser). **Do you still protect them?**

Does "protection" mean shielding the guilty from justice? Or do you protect the **innocent from the guilty**?

Moral Friction: Core Betrayal (+6) if you abandon a sworn ward—but also if you protect evil from consequences.

### The Greater Good Dilemma
Abandoning your ward temporarily could save **hundreds**. **Do you leave your post?**

Classic Shieldbearer conflict: immediate duty vs greater protection.

Moral Friction: Significant Compromise (+4) to abandon post, even for good reason.

## Shieldbearer Philosophy

### The Protector's Paradox

**You cannot protect everyone.** Accepting this is essential to survival.

**But you must try anyway.** Not trying is moral death.

High-tier Shieldbearers navigate this paradox by:
- **Choosing wards wisely** (protect those who protect others)
- **Building systems** (train other protectors)
- **Prioritizing innocents** (children, helpless, vulnerable first)
- **Accepting limits** (you are one person, you will fail sometimes)

### When Protection Becomes Control

**Danger**: Over-protecting becomes **controlling**.

"I must protect you" can become "I must control you to keep you safe."

Shieldbearers must navigate:
- When does protection become imprisonment?
- When do you let your ward take necessary risks?
- How do you protect someone's **agency** while protecting their safety?

### The Cost of the Shield

Shieldbearers **pay prices**:
- Physical scars from intercepted blows
- Emotional burden of wards you couldn't save
- Social isolation (you're the protector, not the protected)
- Moral weight of choosing who receives your shield

This cost is the **essence** of the archetype. You bear it willingly.

## Advancement Advice

### Early Game (Novice-Journeyman)

**Focus**: Build basic protective capability

- Endurance (you take hits others don't)

**Domain Recommendation**: Martial (Defensive Mastery tree)

**Gear Priority**: Armor, shields, healing supplies

### Mid Game (Adept-Expert)

**Focus**: Expand scale of protection
- Unit-level defense (protect groups, not just individuals)
- Strategic positioning (hold key terrain)
- Build alliances (collective defense)

**Domain Recommendation**: Martial + Political or Martial + Economic (logistics for protection)

**Tree Expansion**: Unit Leadership, Fortification, or Alliance Building

### Late Game (Master-Apex)

**Focus**: Create systems that outlive you
- Train other protectors
- Build defensive institutions
- Establish protective alliances that endure
- Become **symbol** of protection (your presence inspires others to protect)

**Domain Recommendation**: Multi-domain (Martial + Political + Economic for comprehensive protection)

**Legacy Goal**: Build protection that doesn't depend on you personally

## Shieldbearer and Draconic Attention

**Good News**: Basic protection doesn't attract Dragons

**Bad News**: High-tier protective actions can destabilize realms

### Low Draconic Attention
- Protecting individuals or small groups
- Local defense (village, caravan)
- Personal bodyguarding

### Moderate Draconic Attention (+2-4 Severity)
- Establishing protective coalitions that shift power
- Building fortifications that change territorial control
- Protecting individuals Dragons want exposed/vulnerable

### High Draconic Attention (+6-8 Severity)
- Protecting Monument research that reveals truths
- Shielding realm-shaking figures from Dragon intervention
- Building defensive systems that resist Dragon authority

**Shieldbearer Dilemma**: If Dragons threaten your ward, **do you stand between them and a Dragon?**

Most Shieldbearers would. That's suicidal—and perfectly in character.
